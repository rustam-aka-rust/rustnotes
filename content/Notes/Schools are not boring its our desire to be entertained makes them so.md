## Schools Are Not Boring; It’s Our Desire for Entertainment That Makes Them Seem So

- For many years, I’ve believed that schools are institutions that [[why schools and modern education kill creativity|stifle creativity]]. This was a view I strongly held.
	- I listened to Ken Robinson, read numerous books and articles that reinforced my perspective.
	- I’ve always thought that schools needed to undergo transformation—and I still believe this. But how could I have been so oblivious to what students, the youth entrusted to its care, actually expect from school?
	- They do not attend school to be educated; they come seeking entertainment. When they don’t find it, they become disinterested.
	- No one, including their parents, has conveyed or ingrained in them the fundamental principle upon which the foundation of education rests.
		- School is not a place of leisure, but a realm of diligence, struggle, hardship, tears, and growth.
		- Growth is a painful process, and schools exist to cultivate growth, educate, and nurture intelligence in children. Yet, paradoxically, this is precisely what is not expected from teachers or the system.
	- The moment this contradiction becomes apparent to students (and not to the teachers) is when we begin to witness resistance and defiance.
- The issue I am addressing is twofold, if not multifaceted.
	- The first aspect lies in what captivates students—and by this, I mean what commands their attention. If you observe closely, it becomes evident that platforms like YouTube, social media feeds, and TikTok trends are nothing more than modern-day coliseums for them.
		- It's a form of passive spectatorship, an emblem of consumer culture. Some in English-speaking countries refer to it as “consumer-cool.”
	- The second aspect is the absence of innate curiosity—a burning drive, a unique force of spirit and intellect.
		- The minds of today’s youth are not accustomed to sustained effort but have instead been conditioned by instant gratification and, in extreme cases, addiction.
	- ! This manifests in their insatiable desire to consume more and more while contributing less and less (**watch more and more and do less and less**).
		- Later in life, this morphs into a habitual disengagement from reality, living in a virtual or vicarious existence. The majority of people become spectators of others’ lives, typically curated on social media, and readily consumable through on-demand content.
		- Very few manage to escape this hypnotic stupor. The entirety of their time, allotted by fate or providence, is spent experiencing life second- or third-hand through a screen.
		- To them, life becomes akin to passing a forgotten station on a train, bound for a destination they can neither grasp nor fully comprehend. Life transforms into a spectacle—entertaining to watch but intangible, impossible to touch.
			- This kind of mindset allows them to remain untouched by life’s true essence.
	- Their expectations of education mirror this passive consumerism:
		- q “What have you got to show me that I haven’t already seen?”
