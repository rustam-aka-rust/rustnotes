## Complex Skills Need More Than the “Think What You Do” Aspect to Improve

- The principle of “think about what you do” is not the best possible solution.
	- Perhaps there is something to this idea that is usually overlooked.
	- According to psychologists, there are other aspects to becoming better at whatever you are engaged in[^1]. Below, some of their ideas, that actually align with my practice, and some quite insightful.
- *Focus* on one aspect of the skill.
	- Skills are usually complex and [[Three stages of skill acquisition, the scaffolding|require a juggling]] of attention, which can be confusing. So, instead of switching between tasks, pick one approach and apply it consistently. *Hammer and nail.*
	- This is why the first two lessons in a reading course are so effective; they focus on only one aspect per lesson. In contrast, paraphrasing and grokking involve several approaches.
- How to *choose what aspect to train*? In piano or martial arts, it’s straightforward; you start with the basics and gradually move to more complex stuff.
	- But what about cognitive tasks? It seems that science, and even biology, have played a role in determining this sequence.
		- With skills that lack a clear learning order, we should start with the basics, focusing on areas where we are less capable.
		- In reading, it’s skimming; in mind mapping – building a network of ideas from the text; in paraphrasing – reflection; in grokking – translating reflection into instructional text.
	- It means we have to work on it, and as soon as we master one aspect, move to another where we are less competent.
- *Feedback* is crucial in understanding where you are inept.
	- The lack of feedback is a significant gap in education. How can I provide consistent and sustainable feedback to a group of 30+ students? It’s nearly impossible.
	- If I start giving individual feedback, then what? How will this affect the pace of group work? Drastically, to say the least.
		- *Perhaps I could review their work after we’ve finished, and record myself, or take notes on what I would have done differently.*
		- I’d like to find a way to give feedback faster than word-by-word analysis.
	- This is a significant topic to consider, as it's a huge obstacle in a way of improvement.
	- Students must be observed, and feedback provided at the moment help is needed.
- *Change your approach* when something isn’t working.
	- Don’t waste time repeating the same ineffective methods.
	- Instead of making small adjustments, consider completely reworking your approach.
		- This applies to my thoughts about future courses on how to read books. I plan to start by reshaping the course towards a [[SOAR (Select, Organise, Associate, Regulate)#Линейный текст изживает свою полезность|graphical representation]].
			- Brainstorming ideas.
			- Using graphical organizers.
			- Creating concept maps.
- *Concentrate on the order of actions* and how you perform them.
	- It might seem like trivial advice, but it’s crucial to focus intently on what you are doing.
	- The action should be engaging and immersive. It’s like scaffolding in skill acquisition.
		- As Galperin [[Action oriented approach#The primary qualities of action|preached in his work]], skill acquisition should be gradual.
		- Eventually, this leads to subconscious proficiency, a result of concentrated (intentional) effort, which is called experience.
		- *That’s where lies the difference between intentional practice and mere activity.*
		- This mental effort initially causes discomfort, but eventually leads to satisfaction.
			- If you’re not tired after practice, you’re probably not doing it correctly.
			- Moreover, if you experience frustration, what does that indicate to me as a coach? That you either don’t believe in the process, are not doing it correctly, or worse, find it all meaningless.
				- Which is a far more concerning issue.
- *Plan your work.* This might sound obvious, but it’s crucial for mastering complex skills.
	- These skills require significant time and effort.
	- The [[The goal of any KM system should lies in innovation horizon|planning horizon]] should be measured in years, not months or weeks.
	- However, this can be flexible, possibly slightly less than a year, or a bit more, depending on the skill and efficiency of the practice sessions.
