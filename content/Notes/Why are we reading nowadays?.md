## Why are we reading nowadays?

- This idea never occurred to me before. I had assumed this to be the case, but Wolf managed to articulate it succinctly.
    - q I still bought many books, but more and more **I read in them, rather than being whisked away by them.** At some time impossible to pinpoint, I had begun to **read more to be informed** than to be immersed, much less to be transported.
- The simple concept: a reader creates a list not to be transformed, but to be merely informed. This is not inherently negative, but rather ineffectual.
    - Informed to do what exactly?
    - Reading is still an effortful process. We must allocate resources and manifest a semblance of intention.
    - Commence and complete reading, organize highlights from the book, find a quiet place to reflect, and process information from the book into something actionable in reality.
    - Reading is a catalyst for change. A person who embarks on a reading journey will be transformed by the end of it.
- The demanding reader doesn’t read to be informed; he reads to be transformed.
    - He knows how to apply someone else’s wisdom to reality.
    - The demanding reader is a master experimenter, who artfully manipulates ideas to transform the space he occupies.
