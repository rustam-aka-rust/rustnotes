### No place for randomness. Really?
- Here, our perception of reality changes. ^8ecb39
	- Suvorov was a believer that there is no place for randomness on a battlefield. 
	- I think that he wasn‚Äôt telling the whole truth. Battlefield is a place of storm and randomness. You can‚Äôt plan long enough and thoroughly enough to be ready for every unaccounted event.
	- To be honest, most people, even Suvorov, don‚Äôt understand personal limits.
		- What we know, how we know and where from this knowledge comes from.
	- Thus, statements that everything and every are accounted for ‚Äì lie.
		- But there is a grain of common sense. *We should plan to some extent, but where the lies the limit of detalization?*
	- In stick to simplicity as close as you can. At war as in business, simple solutions are the best one.

### The simpler the better
- Modern management schools don‚Äôt teach any useful skills.
	- They are so far from the ground that don‚Äôt perceive the needs in education at the bottom.
	- Though, education is the most important aspect in any line of work.
		- Take me for a moment. I thought that I could teach, but as soon as I began realizing my aspiration, I‚Äôve found that teaching is not a simple book and homework approach.
		- Homework is even counterproductive in a sense.
		- So, what have I done? Went to the University to get a degree.
		- And even there I haven‚Äôt been told the most essential features of teaching. I had to dig for them myself through practice.
		- What are the most critical parts in teaching?
			- Emotion.
			- Interest of student in teacher and vice versa.
			- Context you present material (it must touch interests of the students).
	- If we draw analogies, this could be taught, we don‚Äôt know yet how.
	- And in business the same.
		- What skills I needed the most when working in GPN?
		- Communication, no, I don‚Äôt think so.
	- *What skills could be counted in your line of work. In a field and in an office?*
	- *What are the basic principles in your work? What accounts for the biggest part of work?* ^0de682

	- And he did that by giving the source of the most influential written works in war literature.
	- *We can start by making a list of works that you think could benefit you and improve the quality of your work*
	- Then we switch to a person you admire the most. A role-model you can look at and mentally consult in an hour of need.

		- Inspiration begins aspiration.
		- ![[Mindful Self-Discipline Living with Purpose and Achieving Your Goals in a World of Distractions#^c522a1]]
	- We can even create our model, traits are more that enough and a bit of self-talk.
- Space for self education is important.
	- Culture of book clubs in the companies is underdeveloped. I can go as far as make proclamation that it non-existent.
	- There is no place where managers can gather and talk about the topic of a book. Companies want to do it, but they usually stop at buying corporate access to the library, such as ASPINA or MIF, I, personally, had one in GPN. 
		- How far did it get me? Nowhere, to be honest.
		- Environment and community are even more essential than means.
		- So, what that I have anything I want? I don‚Äôt have the most important thing: time, energy, company, etc.
	- DoDo successfully has created and are creating still their book club. And they began not with buying books, but from reading and discussing.
		- *Can you state three lessons that you‚Äôve drawn from our meetings, club wise?*
- Valery speculated that the only thing we should self-educate is self-esteem.
	- But not the esteem that locks a person inside his egocentric views. 
	- Through service to others and submitting oneself to higher ideals, we open ourselves to true self-realization.
		- Again [[Harry Potter and the methods of rationality#Ambitions]]
	- Since only in under these circumstances, people feel themselves happy for real and can conjure miracles.

### Liberalism is a form of traitorism
- For a long time I couldn‚Äôt understand my nonacceptance of liberal values. Though they are sound and human centered, I don‚Äôt like them.
	- I feel myself as a boy from hell from Strugatsky‚Äôs story.

		- Where a person comes first.
		- It poisons our officer‚Äôs honesty, simple honor such love for motherland, family, friends, and community.
	- Instead of that it puts in the front row, self-love, selfishness, vanity.
		- Reason of this simple, this type of people are easy to manipulate.
		- All their wishes revolve around consuming, they have egoistic I, where selfless we is needed.[^1]

### Everyone requires a mascot
