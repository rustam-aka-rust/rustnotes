		- Environment and community are even more essential than means.
		- So, what that I have anything I want? I don’t have the most important thing: time, energy, company, etc.

		- *Can you state three lessons that you’ve drawn from our meetings, club wise?*
- Valery speculated that the only thing we should self-educate is self-esteem.
	- But not the esteem that locks a person inside his egocentric views.
