Annotation:: "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A memoir of leadership and success: The executive chairman of Disney, Time’s 2019 businessperson of the year, shares the ideas and values he embraced during his fifteen years as CEO while reinventing one of the world’s most beloved companies and inspiring the people who bring the magic to life. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR Robert Iger became CEO of The Walt Disney Company in 2005, during a difficult time. Competition was more intense than ever and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company’s history. His vision came down to three clear ideas: Recommit to the concept that quality matters, embrace technology instead of fighting it, and think bigger—think global—and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets. Today, Disney is the largest, most admired media company in the world, counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and he is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our era. In The Ride of a Lifetime, Robert Iger shares the lessons he learned while running Disney and leading its 220,000-plus employees, and he explores the principles that are necessary for true leadership, including: • Optimism. Even in the face of difficulty, an optimistic leader will find the path toward the best possible outcome and focus on that, rather than give in to pessimism and blaming. • Courage. Leaders have to be willing to take risks and place big bets. Fear of failure destroys creativity. • Decisiveness. All decisions, no matter how difficult, can be made on a timely basis. Indecisiveness is both wasteful and destructive to morale. • Fairness. Treat people decently, with empathy, and be accessible to them. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as the lowliest studio grunt at ABC. It’s also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the Star Wars mythology. “The ideas in this book strike me as universal” Iger writes. “Not just to the aspiring CEOs of the world, but to anyone wanting to feel less fearful, more confidently themselves, as they navigate their professional and even personal lives.”"

	- *So what horizons do you work with?*

- Innovation is a risky process, sometimes it works itself into something great, but most of the time the process fails the creators.

- No matter how big is your idea, make sure it brings bread on the table at the end of the day.

	- The thing is, that the world needs only a few quarts a year.
	- Great example of actionable feedback.

		- The world doesn’t need it at all.
	- The piece of paper became an artifact of self reflection and contemplation of the outcomes of difficult future projects.

### Respect and treasure your time and time of others
- The straw that broke the back of executive had become nightmarish meeting routine.
	- Ovitz couldn’t be relied on. Meeting after meeting had been cancelled or ruined by his behaviour.
	- Being busy is not the same as doing your job. Management is science.
	- It as precise as math and as hard as hauling sacks in the port.
		- Managing people is always hard.
	- Do not neglect your work and pull your weight. Otherwise, you’ll become ballast yourself, and usually ballast is cut off in the end. This fate didn’t pass Ovitz.

	- [[How to Think Like a Roman Emperor - Donald J Robertson#^c0857a]]

		- What’s the problem that I need to solve?
		- Does this solution make sense?

	- Almost the same as searching for the third alternative.
		- [[How to Actually Change Your Mind - Eliezer Yudkowsky#^02f0f6]]
	- If you avoid asking hard questions or stalling them, it only means that you are afraid of answers.

### Get the best out of your ambitions without vision are counterproductive
- They keep you in place, hinder the progress (professional and personal).
	- As a leader keep an eye for those around you, who are eager to be risen, not the noisy type.
	- Give them something to care and do under supervision.
	- As long as the position they care about or future prospects do not disturb them.
- Don’t allow ambition to bypass the opportunity.
	- Opportunity is a lifeline of and ambition.
	- If it doesn’t provide, means to fulfill the ambition, then you’ve chosen the wrong aspiration.
	- Opportunity is the driving force behind your successes.
	- The same could be said about habits, personal identity.
		- Habits and new identity emerges, only when your opportunity in physical and digital space allow it.

	- Avoid spending energy on those clamoring around and noise personalities.
	- M. Ovitz?

### Basics of management of hard people
- It’s not an easy feat to enlist people to your cause.
	- Moving people from one camp to another is a science.
	- Which not many people understand.
	- Arguments and good explanation should be enough, but occasionally, they are not enough.
	- Because a person can be difficult. He is either talented or stubborn with certain influence in the topic.
	- Democracy is good in during the time of tranquility, but when we can have such a time? Only in the grave.
- Working through people’s reservations and concerns is a heavy duty of any manager, but sometimes (often than not), we have little or no time at all.
	- It could be moments of crisis, urgency.
	- At these moments, it really comes to what you believe is right.
	- Democratic methods are good for morale, but bad and crisis management.
	- Shut up and do your thing is the approach during the rough moments. Even in the face of disagreement, it’s better to force people to do, then face losses and consequences of inaction.
	- [[Чем выше риск тем жестче коммуникация]].

### Details as important as big picture
- Every person you meet is a teacher, that provides valuable lessons, even though in the end it might turn ugly.
	- Michael, the CEO of Disney animation in 1984–2004 taught Iger the importance of seeing perspective without losing details.
	- What’s important, pattern of intricate complexity of details.
	- There is no small detail in business, especially such as Disney.
	- Everything leads to everything, and when you have trouble on one side, interconnectedness brings trouble to another side of the complexity web.
	- When I fired people from retail, then HR was stressed.
	- When we lacked a good training center, then the rate of firing increased, and HR was under even more pressure.
	- When HR didn’t provide enough staff for new stations, then retail had to move staff inside and outside the region and risk overtime.
- Look at the big picture, but don’t miss small details, monitor connectedness and search for equilibrium.
	- [[Оргуправленческое мышление]] Shedrovitsky mentioned the need of balance between two types of managers. The same could be applied here, and in every domain of life.
- *What is balance in your line of work?*

### Pessimistic leader is retinueless
- No matter that humanity exists thanks to our pessimistic world view.
	- No one for real doesn’t want to follow a dour leader.
	- It’s a task of leader to say the truth and set up the expectations for reality.
	- But it’s a bad trait to brighten the picture, on the eve of the crisis.
	- People and you should be able to steer away from rough circumstances.

### Playing a good game with a bad hand
- When a decision about him hasn’t been reached yet, and the line of succession on Disney stayed unclear.
	- Iger shown the spirit to confront his superiors and force them to do what must be done, even if he won’t be named as the next CEO.
	- What was it? Strategy or shrewdness?
- Never blame the prior leader.
	- He didn’t exactly defend Michael before the board, but nonetheless he was able to say his mind and the very idea that struck home is that everything that is happening in any company, is not about past mistakes.
	- It’s about the future, obviously we can elaborate on the past, but we don’t get a do-over, so what’s the point?
	- Better to make a bold move and stir the company away from the cliff.

### Prioritization could be done of precious few rather than a broad vague
- In some books, I’ve read that priorities, before it became mainstream, has been only singular.
	- You couldn’t get more than one priority.
	- But now, it’s possible on paper, but impossible in real life.
	- [[Essentialism The Disciplined Pursuit of Less#^054cab]]
	- So when you choose to set up a succession of important tasks, choose one.
	- Iger picked three, and he did wisely. One of them has been Pixar, then Marvel and something else.
	- *What are priorities of your company?*

### Respect not only your subordinates but superiors
- It’s hard to go by the lesson, especially if superiors are stupid and cowardly enough to bring the company to its doom.
	- I had the same problem in my line of work.
	- But Iger suggest finding something to cling onto, like recognizing what a person needs, ultimately it’s respect and nothing more.
	- Bring it to the table and all problems will be solved
	- [[Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes are High#^59923b]] lesson all over again.

### Boldness is an act, not a condition
- If you wish to cooperate with people who regularly disrupt business not only their own but of the whole industries, like Steve Jobs, you have to demonstrate boldness in your every move and act.
	- And then you act in synchrony, which is important with bold people.
	- Be willing to take the risk. I actually think that disruptive attitude towards business came from his interaction with Jobs in his first acquisition.
- With boldness, planning matter less than instincts, and instincts come from mistakes or from deep thinking.
	- The only thing certain is fuck-up, everything else is just luck.
	- No need to over plan, if you know the vector or place where you want to be, go for it.
		- Something along the way will occur, means to overcome obstacle emerge with the obstacles.
	- Even when you have dozens of cons, look for a couple of sound pros that could easily overweight the cons.
	- It’s a powerful way of thinking. 
	- The strategy of Steve had always been [[#Innovate or die]] so he stuck to it and lived with it.
	- It's like with traders who fret and worry with fluctuation of price.
		- If you have time proofed strategy, work with it and act accordingly, don’t change processes, in the face of changes. 
		- If, on the other hand, you don’t believe in your strategy, then it is due time to change something.
		- *Who can influence your strategy?* Some role model you want to become, new identity or what?
		- Iger said that he wished for real to Steve to have and influence over Disney. And what about the rest of the businessmen?

### Be ready to leave
- Leave when you are on top. Have a back-up plan.
	- Create a failsafe mechanics from classical mistakes of the leader. Overconfidence.
	- Don’t be dismissive of others and opinions of others, take a look at multiple views.
	- It requires conscious effort.
	- Tell everyone that if they see you as dismissive or impatient or too rude, that they have to tell you about this.
	- And have a way out when you are the most effective. Accumulation of too much power brings trouble.
