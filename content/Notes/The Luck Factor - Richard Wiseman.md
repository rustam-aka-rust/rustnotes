Annotation:: "IS LUCK REAL? Why do some people lead happy successful lives whilst other face repeated failure and sadness? Why do some find their perfect partner whilst others stagger from one broken relationship to the next? What enables some people to have successful careers whilst others find themselves trapped in jobs they detest? And can unlucky people do anything to improve their luck - and lives? Ten years ago, Professor Richard Wiseman decided to search for the elusive luck factor by investigating the actual beliefs and experiences of lucky and unlucky people. The results reveal a radical new way of looking at luck: in many important ways, we make our own luck. If you think you're unlucky, that bad luck may be the direct result of you believing you're unlucky. Wiseman identifies the four simple behavioural techniques that have been scientifically proven to help you attract good fortune. He then shows how you can use these methods to revolutionise every area of your life - including your relationships, personal finances and career."

### üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences

### üé® Impressions
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs so interesting about the book, that it has high ratings and so many talks. In my opinion, the usual book with nothing special. I‚Äôve highlighted a lot, but I still think, though it isn‚Äôt processed, yet, nothing serious will come out of it.
#### How I Discovered It

#### Who Should Read It?
Those who still think that bad luck is for life.

### ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me

> Don‚Äôt know what, but something has changed. After I‚Äôll arrange notes in a semblance of structure, change patter will emerge.

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes

## üìí Ideas
### General idea
- Luck is not something permanent, it could be changed for the best or for the worst.
	- The way it changes, dependent on our behaviour and attitude towards life.
- It‚Äôs not an inborn superpower ability, or something supernatural, but nothing more than an opportunistic approach to life.
	- Be in the right place in the right time, with the right people.
	- Lucky people, without realizing it, exploit simple actions to create or in some cases invite good fortune to their lives.
- Events obviously happen by chance, even those who planned them ahead, nothing ever works out according to the plan, something always goes awry, and this is a moment where good or bad luck comes into play.
	- No matter how good your plan is, dice are rolling, what happens no one knows.
	- Karl Popper strongly believed in the [[The Poverty of Historicism - Karl Popper#Fallacy of rational planning|chaotic structure of reality]].
	- Something must be pushing things in a certain direction in a good way for one type of people, in a bad way for another. So what it could be?
	- According to Wiseman, good luck is nothing more than a behavioural patter, which could be changed or programmed.

### Simple actions that invite luck
- Before we dive into actions, let‚Äôs see what for really happens with lucky people, that doesn‚Äôt with unlucky.
	- *Encounter chance opportunity*. That‚Äôs an opportunistic part.
		- Meet interesting people by chance, find something interesting in magazines, find money on the pavement.
	- *Make good decisions unknowingly*.
		- Trust someone, go with the gut feeling in decision-making.
		- Listen to your gut feeling and go with the hunches.
		- Boost your intuition.
			- Wiseman actually speaks about intuition as a mean for boosting intuition. 
			- In my mind, it‚Äôs [[#Boost your intuition not with meditation, but with information|a highly controversial thought]].

	- **Listen** to your lucky **hunches**.

### Expectations, sometime matter more, than action and intelligence
- No matter how smart you are, things tend to happen through some cosmic guidance, and we don‚Äôt know about Divine Providences‚Äô plan or us.
	- It means only one thing, doesn‚Äôt matter how smart you are, [[An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth - Chris Hadfield#The worse is yet to come, anticipate it|how many plans b on plans be you‚Äôve devised]], if something deems to happen, it will.
	- And you can‚Äôt do anything about it.

### Opportunities

- Luck in general is a matter of personality, or in my case ‚Äì [[Identity course|identity]].

		- Agreeableness.
		- Conscientiousness.
		- Extroversion.
		- Neuroticism.
		- Openness.
	- Would it be possible to connect to the [[Mindful Self-Discipline Living with Purpose and Achieving Your Goals in a World of Distractions#Pillars of a life|pillars]]?

### Attitude towards life, be water my friend
- I like this quote by Bruce Lee. Water is a force that can nurture and destroy without effort.
	- Like water in the orchid and water in tsunami wave. Both the same, but the consequences are evidently different.
	- Trickle in the orchid always finds its way to a tree or a bush that asks for it.
	- A tsunami, on the other hand, smashes everything without defining what is what.
- The same is fair for grim and lucky people, the first group usually smashes their way through, the second navigates surgically, looking for a window of opportunity.
	- When we are accurate with physical and digital environment, we tend to notice a substitution of cards, an important message at the bottom of the second page, that has been written in tiny letters. Or capital, if that matters at all.
- BTW, a similar attitude must be applied to reading, too. Don‚Äôt fixate, think broader, then you can notice connections and an opportunity to build a bridge between concepts might arise.
	- Like this, thought is interestingly connected with and idea, working [[–†–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ —Ä–∞–¥–∏ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã|for the sake of working]].
- It‚Äôs impossible to attain a high position or have good results if a person is too tense. [Be water, my friend, be water](https://youtu.be/cJMwBwFj5nQ).

### Boost your intuition not with meditation, but with information
- Hunches, gut feelings are the product of intuition.
	- Or it seems so. According to Wiseman, participants of his research implemented one or another meditative technique to boost their intuition and consequently luck.
	- In my opinion, [[–ö–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∏–Ω—Ç—É–∏—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ –ú–µ–¥–∏—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è –º–µ—à–∞–µ—Ç –º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é|if not harmful, this advice is extremely counterintuitive]], let‚Äôs dive a little bit into the topic.
- As far as I can understand, after reading several books on meditation, it is the process in which we contemplate our thoughts.
	- We do not look for additional information, we don‚Äôt enrich our knowledge or boost our understanding of a problem.
	- We meditate, just watch and listen to our thoughts. Ok, I can accept that, but what if we lack information? No matter how long we meditate, the solution will be either wrong or incomplete.
- How I understand the process of problem-solving, it is the process of getting just enough information for solution, by avoiding information gluttony and hunger.
	- Meditation doesn‚Äôt bring anything except maybe a feeling of self-soothing.

### Think positively, the only worth way to think
- I am not talking about closing yourself from every negative expectation.
	- What I mean is that don‚Äôt expect anything bad from your ventures.
	- The difference between believing and expecting success and not believing is the same as achieving and not.
	- Expect good luck in the future, not just a lucky event, but a string of lucky events.
		- Don‚Äôt stop, even if the chances of success not great.
		- You don‚Äôt stop thinking and doing something, under extreme conditions. Not acting can‚Äôt be an excuse for not doing.
		- We are not in the space, where a price of a mistake is death, we are here on earth, making plans B for possible negative outcomes and moving steadily to your goal helps you in building necessary resilience.
		- Just yesterday explained to a girl, bright and highly intelligent, that not trying because doesn‚Äôt matter what I do it‚Äôs not working, couldn‚Äôt be possibly counted as an excuse for not graduating from school with flying banners.
			- So what, that you‚Äôve given up on math? Of course, it leads to more spare time that you can devote to studying other subjects. It‚Äôs ok to give up, but not ok to have the attitude of a loser. You have to persevere in the face of possible failure.
		- Expect that your interaction with the teacher will be successful. You can prove your point and improve yourself, even if you‚Äôve failed.
			- Failing is normal, loser‚Äôs attitude is not.
