- She reminds us from every lead turn that we are to encounter paradoxes of learning.
	- What are they?

- Breathing solves the majority of worrisome problems.
	- She provided the example of falling asleep.

- Creativity is a ‚ÄúJust do it!‚Äù game. We can blend into our recipe several ingredients provided.

- Creativity is also a leap of intuition. The most difficult problems are solved when you make a leap of faith from what you are familiar with to the scary unknown.

- Barbara suggests that the best way to learn something is to create conceptual chunks of information.
	- It‚Äôs well-known fact, since the definition of [[Lifelong learning]] had been invented.
	- You have to glue new knowledge to something you already know. Build informational carcass.
	- Unite separate bits of information through shared meaning.

- What to do if you have limited time. You are a family person with chores to do and things to attend to, such as bringing up your children, quality time with family, shopping, etc.
- There is a solution to this.
	- Read what you need to read, or what you‚Äôve been given for assignment. Prime yourself for the next step.
	- Review the lecture notes. Better rewrite them when you are able to do it. My time is from 5 am to 7 am. Connect them with what you‚Äôve already got in your knowledge base.
	- Rework example math or any other science problems from the notes. Same as rewriting notes from social science.

	- [[Atomic Habits#All innovation require disruption]] similar to the following approach.
	- The Cue Trigger that launches procrastination or call to action. It‚Äôs reaction to distraction we need to mind.
	- The Routine. Brain responses to the cue in a manner it always has done. 
		- It can be harmful (notification on the phone leads to scrolling through social media feed)
		- It can be useful, a book on the bed table may lead to picking it and reading.
	- The Reward. Bad habits give an easy dopamine jolt, good habits on the other hand are hard to get high from, need to consciously seek pleasure.
	- The Belief. Habits have power over you, because you believe in them. Change your underlying belief to change a habit.
- *Conclusion*. The only place you need to exert willpower is your reaction to the cue.

> Always study under mild pressure. Build tolerance to it. Your functions under great stress will improve if you constantly work under mild one. Set time limit, e.g.

		- Did I for real liked being in corporation, managing fools and earning top money for what I did? I willingly had put myself into a gilded cage and fooled myself into thinking that I was happy. 
		- It happens left and right, just watch at the root of unhappiness.
	- We develop passion for what we are good at.
		- Wasn‚Äôt I good in corporation?
		- Am I good now, because I enjoy what I do, or again I fool myself?

- Memory is essential for becoming creative.
	- Facts that we are memorizing are the building block for chunking, imagining unusual pairing and coming up with interesting solutions.
	- [[Moonwalking with Einstein - Joshua Foer]] is given here as an entry point into research done by Foer and detailed explanation of the fact that memory is just a set of fancy tricks.
	- Watch [his talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6PoUg7jXsA) on the TED stage.

- Don‚Äôt rely on conventional learning, begin tinkering.
	- Discover WHY and HOW behind the phenomenon.
	- Tinkering gives deeper understanding.

		- Drawing on deeply ingrained repertoire of knowledge chunks.
	- [[–ë—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ –º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –°1]]

- The more you know, the more you hold dear to what you know.
	- And it is exactly what makes you less creative.
	- Research has shown that smart people tend to find complex and I would say complicated solutions to a problem.
	- Not so clever on the other hand, cut right to the simplest solution.

- A synthesized knowledge is an abstraction, or gist idea in other words, a neural pattern which could be easily applied across domains. ^d5d9af
	- Good chunking resonated not only with problems at hand, but also transfers ideas to other subjects and areas of our lives.
	- The higher the level of abstraction, the easier you transfer ideas from one area to another.

- *How do we set our mind to receive new knowledge?* Priming ourselves? Open book approach.

- Feynman pointed to his friend once that thinking is nothing more than talking to yourself inside.  ^76013a
	- Or in KB, Lumahn used to talk inside his Zettelkasten.
	- The complexity of the base could be built from the simplicity of ideas, the only thing you must absolutely follow is necessity to connect and reconnect. Tiny shifts in one place make ripples in the other, as with this idea, which affects the philosophy of note-taking. Connectivity issue.
	- Ultimately, it alters everything else.
	- An observant gardener (person who tends his base), can recognize the depth of a piece of information, it can have many possible meanings.
- On explanation in Feynman style.
	- While trying to explain a complex topic, imagine that you are talking to a child, 5 y.o.
	- Use the simplest possible words and principles.
	- On Reddit the whole section exists, devoted to such explanations.

	- Applying laws of physics, e.g. working with electricity.
	- Calculating the diameter of the car wheel.
- Transferring knowledge from imaginary domain to a real life situation, make even the most complex problem look easy and solvable.
	- There is another benefit, it makes learning easier. 
		- If you transfer, you will be able to do more and more through the term.
		- This effect is reached with the ability to bring all together. Classroom knowledge and various life situations.

- Approaching term materials should be done not with ‚Äúpass the test‚Äù attitude, but with ‚ÄúTruly understand‚Äù
	- The goal of learning gives a unique path to mastery.
	- Teacher and handed material is predetermined and fabricated for specific group of learners, often it consists of absolutely minimum set of chapters. Enough to pass the test.
	- This is a partial version, maximally shortened. It doesn‚Äôt provide the full, three-dimensional reality of the subject, which could be linked to other fascinating subjects of personal choosing.
	- Teacher centeredness fosters unavoidably helplessness about learning among students, which later transfers to older life. At universities, in relationships.
		- Test evaluation have the same results. 
		- [[Finnish Lessons#^90a9d0]]

- On bad traits and possibility to use them for your benefit.
	- Pick a seemingly bad trait. Consider it from all angles, see if any positive effects exist, look carefully, usually there is.
	- Look from the vantage point that covers the creativity aspect touched by this trait. How it makes you more creative or more energized.
	- Can you diminish its negative effects and enhance positive?

- Healthy dissent and disagreement are valuable for development of good idea and throwing away bad.
	- Debate is one of the knowledge generation approach.

	- It‚Äôs highly valuable to have someone who can give open and honest feedback without toxicity. ^1046c5
		- This kind of safe for new thinking environment, hard to come with. It requires careful tending from influencers.
		- Bohr, a genius who intuited quantum theory, was so respected that nobody could say anything except praise to any of his, even cockamamie ideas.
		- And this was unhelpful. So he had found himself a student who could argue with him and scrutinize ideas before presenting them to the public.
			- And this one of the reason the world had Feynman, legendary student of Bohr.
			- Actually not, according to Feynman‚Äôs, this account, had taken place on Los Alamos, and Bohr with his son, came to the laboratory anonymously. 
			- Bohr asked for Feynman on purpose, because he used to be the only one who wasn‚Äôt afraid to stand up for his ideas.
			- Feynman didn‚Äôt care about who was standing in front of him, his mind worked in a state of deep concentration, when the topic of physics had been touched. This super ability helped him outperform many before him. This and another one [[Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman Adventures of a Curious Character#Prankster Feynman]]
			- [[–ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤–æ–º—ã—Å–ª–∏–µ –∏ –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç]]

		- Scrutinizing should be done to all things that we consider doing, that have high exposure to risk.
			- [[Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes are High#^ba59b5]]
		- Criticism is not about a person, it is aimed at what you are trying to understand. Questions are born out of curiousity and the need to know what and how.

- `The Strength of Weak Ties by Mark Granovetter` read and analyze.
	- [[Granovetter Weak Ties AJS.pdf]]
	- The article predicts how the number of just acquaintances you have and not the number of friends predicts your access to the latest ideas as well as access to the job market.

**Yes No 3.** Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before working with classmates?
***Test Preparation***
The more ‚ÄúYes‚Äù responses you recorded, the better your preparation for the test. If you recorded two or more ‚ÄúNo‚Äù responses, think seriously about making some changes in how you prepare for the next test.

**Yes No 6.** Did you understand ALL of your homework problem solutions when they were handed in?
**Yes No 7.** Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that weren‚Äôt clear to you?
**Yes No 8.** If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself that you could do everything on it?
**Yes No 9.** Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly, without spending time on the algebra and calculations?
**Yes No 10.** Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one another?
**Yes No 11.** If there was a review session before the test, did you attend it and ask questions about anything you weren‚Äôt sure about?
**Yes No 12**. Did you get a reasonable night‚Äôs sleep before the test? (If your answer is no, your answers to 1‚Äì11 may not matter.)
**Yes No TOTAL**
