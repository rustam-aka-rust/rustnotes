## Note-taking could be considered a form of creative writing that aids in interpreting the book and the author’s ideas

- The majority of note-takers typically create notes that are purely functional—often just a line of text or a copy-pasted quote from the internet.
    - When I ask them why their notes are so brief and technical, they often look at me with incredulity. What alternative approach could there possibly be, they seem to wonder?
    - They believe that note-taking should be as utilitarian as possible, leaving no room for introspection. This mindset is common among IT specialists and various analysts.
    - Yes, notes should be practical, but there are different forms of practicality.
- One essential point I teach and frequently emphasize in my writing is that notes serve as a tool for self-discovery, allowing their creator to see themselves in a new light. For this kind of revelation to occur, a note-taker must engage in creative writing—an activity that, like creative thinking, is not a frequent practice.
    - The act of creative writing enables the note-taker to glimpse into the future, into potential worlds. These worlds might reveal the self in new perspectives and under unfamiliar conditions.
    - The self and the world a note-taker seeks to explore through creative writing is, in essence, an endeavor to comprehend oneself and the circumstances in which one exists more deeply.
    - Through creative writing, a note-taker aspires to improve not only the world around them but also the quality of their own work. For them, notes are blueprints that can potentially be used to reshape the world and inform future decisions.
- However, the definition of "the world" itself remains ambiguous. What exactly do I mean by it?
    - Is it the water, the soil, and the air? Or something else entirely? Clearly, something else. I cannot hope to improve the physical world; it will take care of itself, with far greater resources than I possess.
    - In the context of this discussion, the world has been a much simpler concept: the realm in which an individual's life and actions unfold.
        - To be more specific, the world is where morning conversations between two loving hearts occur; it is the study where I work, reflect on books, write, read, and process my ideas. It is also the bedroom, where behind closed doors, moments of magic happen.
        - The world encompasses your children, your household, and the way you nurture the former and manage the latter.
- Creative reading, alongside creative writing, helps us gain a deeper understanding of this personal world and improve it. Notes enable you to better see your role and place in your world, thereby facilitating self-improvement and enhancing the world around you.
