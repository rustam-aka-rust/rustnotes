## ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes

## üìí Ideas
### About premises
- Valid premises do not guarantee the validity of the whole argument. [[Critical thinking#^0e9d67]]
	- They only increase chances for the validity of the argument.
	- The more unexpected consequences a proved to be true, the stronger argument they provide for the topic of the argument.

### Proof of conditions
- Situations where proving is in not appliable must be avoided.
	- Though sometime they cannot be proved only at the current level of technology or knowledge.
	- It doesn‚Äôt mean that they won‚Äôt be proved sometime in the future.
- Theoretical validation could be done by applying the theory to the wide range of objects.
	- Ok, we say that PKM is great, by whose standards?
	- If so, then PKM great not only in personal context but in wide range of domains.
		- Education.
		- Business.
		- Science.
		- What else?
	- Proving validity of an initial statement in other domains, we can substantially increase the significance of a new theory or idea.
- An isolated theory or approach stand out as something exceptional rather than innovative and worth trying.

### Simplicity rule
- No need for too complex explanation and theoretical justification.
	- The simpler, the better. [[Critical thinking#Occam‚Äôs razor principle]]
	- New condition must be aligned with existing condition, that has been proved scientifically
		- Though it is preferably, but not compulsory.
- The same could be said about our [[Logical thinking tools in Jedi]], the simpler, the better.
	- The same with *because* part of logical reasoning we are teaching.

### Practical knowledge
- Or the knowledge of a man who practices what he preaches, is seen differently.
	- It‚Äôs a special type of knowledge, self-sufficient.
	- It‚Äôs aimed at a specific situation and requires attention to the context and condition in all it‚Äôs numerous variations.
	- Life is built not from theoretical knowledge, but from a devised solution, applied to a specific problem, that has arisen under certain conditions in a unique context.
		- Tinkering VS Theoretical knowledge. 
		- [[Antifragile books 4 and 5#^b5d025]]
	- Practical knowledge is a permanent correction of beliefs to new conditions.
		- It is an adaptability work of truly new principles.

### Habituality rule
- Stick to the old guns.
	- Avoid innovation where it could be avoided.
	- But not all innovation, only unsupported ones.
	- The ideal object in logical thinking, we should explain the phenomenon with existing tools and not invent new ones. 
		- Although, invention absolutely justified if there is no other way around the problem.
		- [[a tool for conflict resolution Evaporating cloud]] is in a sense the same.
		- Bryzgalova said exactly this when she was looking at my EC
			- ![[evaporating cloud rustam.png]]
		- The best solution is the one where we don‚Äôt need to resolve the conflict.
		- Conflict is avoided with different approach to the problem.


> [!NOTE] Explanation and Understanding
> - *To explain* something is to infer from existing truths.
> - *To understand* something is to infer from accepted evaluations.


### What does it mean to explain
- To align something with already existing.
	- Theory to the rule, it can use as a basis for further inquiries.
	- *But in that case, what could be said about things that so innovative that have to create a set of rules for them?*
	- I can agree that it happens quite rarely, but nonetheless it might happen.
- Ok, if we step aside from rules, theories, and science and dive into the domain of ordinary life.
	- What happens on the level of in-between human interactions.
	- Or on the level of self explanation.
	- Like we do in our course [[Logical thinking tools in Jedi]]
	- At the core, through question if‚Ä¶, then‚Ä¶, in order to do ‚Ä¶, we must‚Ä¶, I want this‚Ä¶ because.
	- And next sequence questions: because, and what else, and how else. We are looking for an explanation.
	- The depth of explanation correlates with the depth and complexity of the theory, rule, and problem.
	- [[Critical thinking#The core of good explanation]]
- Lots of great ideas are covered by Deustsch in [[The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch]]
- *To explain* something is to infer from existing truths.

### Understanding is not what it is
- But what it has to be. (p.***248***)
	- When we explain some phenomenon, even to ourselves, usually we are describing the things the way they are, instead of looking in a different direction.
	- As some said, look not the way the arrow points.
		- [[The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch#Solidness demands understanding]]
		- Feynman also wrote a lot about understanding [[Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman Adventures of a Curious Character]] look there through search of the word `understand`
	- Understanding is the process of matching certain phenomenon or theory or a problem to an explanation.
		- Common caveat is that we tend to fall to description, but it‚Äôs not understanding.
	- Understanding happens when, through *what it is*, we know *what it must be*.
- There are two types of understanding.
	- Strong.
		- Deductive inference. Where one of the premises is: 
			- A common evaluation: *Tragedy must invoke a catharsis.*
			- Another one is a statement about initial condition: *Shakespeare‚Äôs play ‚ÄúHamlet‚Äù is a tragedy*.
			- In a conclusion common evaluation spread over a special case, thus reaching an understanding why certain object must have certain qualities.
	- Weak.
		- Plausible inference.
			- The first premise speaks about means that are needed to get a result: *If we start a fire in the hearth of the house, then it will be warm*.
			- The second premise is an opinion statement, that presents the result as a goal and in the process changing **cause and effect** into **goal ‚Äì mean**: *A home must be warm*.
			- In a conclusion, this type of understanding describes the action which is required to achieve the goal.
			- Weak understanding is a goal-oriented understanding.
				- Goal-oriented understanding presents in details connection between goals, values, and actions.
				- In this case, to know a person is to know the goal the hoped to achieve through specific action he has taken.
	- Beware of weak understanding because it doesn‚Äôt have long-standing resilience to changing conditions and different environments.
		- Common mistake in habits or project verbalization is the same, we tend to set a goal, which is good in a short run, but bad for lifelong habits or stressless perseverance after experienced failure in the project.
			- [[Atomic Habits#System oriented habits]]
		- The same could be stated for a goal in [[Logical thinking tools in Jedi]], it mustn‚Äôt be a weak understanding, but to be fulfilled it has to be a strong one.
			- It could be achieved with the question aimed at proof of success. *How will you prove it?*
- *To understand* something is to infer from accepted evaluations.
- There are three layers of understanding.
	- Understanding actions of human being (agent of change), the origin of his behaviour.
	- Understanding of nature.
	- Understanding of language representation, plain text.

### Theory of Argumentation
- Logical next step logical thinking has made in the course of it‚Äôs evolution.
	-  I think that it is what we really are looking with Maxim for our [[Logical thinking tools in Jedi]]
	- According to Ivin the argumentation theory is the key to the problem of justification the reasoning behind the logic. [[Argumentation Theory]]
		- It‚Äôs not in a sense appliable logic because it speaks about things that are not directly related to logic.
		- I think it speaks primarily about linguistics.
- To understand the source, read Aristotle‚Äôs ‚ÄúRhetoric‚Äù
	- [[How to speak How to listen#^cad737]]

#### Argumentation theory based on smart inquiries
- The same approach used by Socrates, through question he had been seeking truth.
	- It is also a groundwork of problem-based learning
	- [[–ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ]]
