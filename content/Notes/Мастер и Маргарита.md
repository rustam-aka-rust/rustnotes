#### Aftermath of the ballroom



> [!NOTE] WIKI
> On 24 April 1935, Bulgakov was among the invited guests who attended the Spring Festival at [Spaso House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaso_House "Spaso House"), the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, hosted by Ambassador [William Bullitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Christian_Bullitt,_Jr. "William Christian Bullitt, Jr."). Critics believe Bulgakov drew from this extravagant event for his novel. In the middle of the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") and Stalinist repression, Bullitt had instructed his staff to create an event that would surpass every other Embassy party in Moscow's history. The decorations included a forest of ten young birch trees in the chandelier room; a dining room table covered with Finnish tulips; a lawn made of chicory grown on wet felt; a fishnet aviary filled with pheasants, parakeets, and one hundred zebra finches, on loan from the Moscow Zoo; and a menagerie including several mountain goats, a dozen white roosters, and a baby bear.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita#cite_note-13)
> 
> Although [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") didn't attend, the 400 elite guests at the festival included Foreign Minister [Maxim Litvinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov "Maxim Litvinov"), Defense Minister [Kliment Voroshilov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov "Kliment Voroshilov"), Communist Party heavyweights [Nikolai Bukharin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Bukharin "Nikolai Bukharin"), [Lazar Kaganovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazar_Kaganovich "Lazar Kaganovich"), and [Karl Radek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Radek "Karl Radek"), [Soviet Marshals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Marshal "Soviet Marshal") [Aleksandr Yegorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ilyich_Yegorov "Alexander Ilyich Yegorov"), [Mikhail Tukhachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky "Mikhail Tukhachevsky"), and [Semyon Budyonny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semyon_Budyonny "Semyon Budyonny"), and other high-ranking guests.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
> 
> The festival lasted until the early hours of the morning. The bear became drunk on champagne given to him by [Karl Radek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Radek "Karl Radek"). In the early morning hours, the zebra finches escaped from the aviary and perched below the ceilings around the house.
> 
> In his novel, Bulgakov featured the _Spring Ball of the Full Moon_, considered to be one of the most memorable episodes.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita#cite_note-14) On 29 October 2010, seventy-five years after the original ball, [John Beyrle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Beyrle "John Beyrle"), U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation, hosted an Enchanted Ball at Spaso House, recreating the spirit of the original ball as a tribute to Ambassador Bullitt and Bulgakov.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita#cite_note-15)
