## The fun fact or today’s proof of concept

As usual, I have a full house of students in my classroom today—over 30 critical young minds whose only desire seems to be doing nothing. They groaned and pleaded with me to stop teaching and give them time and space to relax. The fact that they’re only in 10th grade doesn’t mean they aren’t exhausted. They work hard enough to be as drained as any adult.

So, instead of letting them rest, I decided to entertain them and opted for a simple yet effective approach. I posted three questions in a Google Forms survey. The first two were intended as warm-up questions: “Who did you want to be when you were a child?” and “Why?” followed by, “What interests you the most?” But the final question was deliberately crafted to confront them with a dilemma, to suggest that something is fundamentally wrong. I asked them, “Why do you hate school?”

Among the various responses, one in particular caught my attention: someone said they hate school because of incompetent teachers. This led me to follow up with a question: “What does ‘incompetent’ mean?” The explanation was long and ambiguous, but it crystallized in a brief exchange:

– You’ve said I am a competent teacher. I’m not teaching you anything at the moment, just entertaining you. What makes me competent?
– You’re interested in us?
