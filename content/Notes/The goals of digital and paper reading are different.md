## The Goals of Digital and Paper Reading are Different

- The written word in the [[Language in 21st century transformed significantly|21st century has evolved significantly]], and the culture of reading has similarly adapted and transformed.
	- New technologies, the ever-increasing deluge of information, and shifts in communication methods have collectively compelled humanity to reassess how it engages with information—often on the go, while waiting in lines, or sitting in traffic. In some cases, individuals interact with information during meetings, casually scrolling through newsletters, messages, and intermittently checking email.
- This transformation has inevitably impacted reading, and today [[Reading happens on the edge of two sides of the coin|we engage with different mediums for distinct purposes]].
	- Paper, as it has been for millennia before [[Информационный взрыв|the explosion of information]], still fulfills its traditional role: to decelerate the reader, facilitate deeper cognitive engagement, and invite them to interpret the material thoughtfully.
	- Digital reading, however, is a completely different experience. This doesn’t mean that interpretation, deep reading, or reflective thinking cannot happen when using an iPad or other gadgets; rather, it indicates that the affordances of digital devices diverge from the sensory experience of holding a physical book.
		- Gadgets serve us well for reading, yet they are primarily tools of convenience—especially as interfaces for search engines that allow us to pinpoint specific passages or even phrases with precision. They condition us to skim, not to read in depth, often promoting a superficial engagement with text as we train our eyes to latch onto keywords that guide us to relevant information.
		- Digital devices introduce novel ways to evaluate and juxtapose information. While paper allows us to arrange two seemingly contradictory articles in a tangible, organized manner, digital screens enable us to place them side by side, scrolling through them effortlessly. In 2024, we can even enlist the assistance of tools like ChatGPT to further our analysis.
		- Digital platforms furnish researchers and project developers with the requisite tools to filter, curate, and distill vast amounts of information efficiently.
	- The objectives of digital and paper reading differ: we turn to paper for education, and we utilize digital mediums for acquiring information.
		- The latter is not inherently negative. Both mediums serve varied purposes, and [[The meaning of the Demanding reader|a demanding reader]] knows how to strike a balance between the two to maintain their intellectual integrity, safeguard against biases, and preemptively recognize attempts to manipulate their views and consumption habits.
		- The skillful balancing of paper and digital resources enables individuals to discern potentially unreliable or mutable information—data that might shift under external influence.
- It doesn’t mean that paper and digital stand against each other, only that teacher and educators in the field have to adapt approaches in teaching and principles they apply to train young and not so young minds.
	- Train how to interact with information, read, calculate and navigate digital strata.
