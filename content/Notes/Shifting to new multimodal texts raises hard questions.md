## Shifting to New Multimodal Texts Raises Hard Questions
- In a new multimodal way of [[Why school are boring#Organization of the material|interacting with the material]], we are at a loss on how to bridge the gap between the print-based way material is presented and the digital way of interacting.
	- But we can make a starting point an exercise that defines reading and literacy.
	- [[How to talk about books you haven't read#Before talking about how to talk, we have to define what is reading|What is reading]] in a new technological age?
		- As Mangen and Weel speculated[^1], it is a thing of two elements:
			- Human-technology interaction.
			- [[The reading environment is often left out of the picture, though it impacts reading significantly#^4a2ba4|Embodied processes]]. But we will dive into the physical aspect really soon.
		- These two questions throw us into deep interdisciplinary aspects of reading.
			- The interaction between the body and the information.
			- The transition from paper to screen forces us to reconsider several serious questions:
				- What distinguishes print-based reading from processing multimodal texts, such as still or moving pictures, images, or even spoken words?
				- In what way does digital information [[Memory, the crucial part of reading and why people with poor memory can’t become strong or demanding readers|affect cognitive outcomes, retention, recall, and comprehension]]?
				- How does the reading experience differ between genres (a novel or a poem), or the source (print, screen of a tablet)?
				- Has the concept of reading changed with the substrate? For example, navigating print text is different from the multiplicity of ever-changing hardware and software configurations involved in screen text.
				- Does the growing digital infrastructure change the social position of books and other texts, and of reading in general?
- The one overarching all these questions is this: have changes in the consumption of information triggered the deterioration of reading and literacy skills overall, potentially caused or accelerated by digitization?
	- Have people spent less time reading, or maybe they are reading, in fact, more, but they do it differently.
	- [[Deep reading as deep work became scarce|Deep reading]]  practices have become rare and have been displaced by shallower forms of reading.
