## Learn like a pro
Summary: an old story told anew.

If you've read "[[Learning How to Learn]]", then "Learn Like a pro" will be secondary and most of the information you got from the first would be repeated. So if you have time to look for something new and renew your understanding of the first, then it is ok to read it.

#### Ideas
Mobile phones are distracting, students who hadn't had a chance to use them inside the classroom, wrote on average 60% more than those who had.

**Short breaks**, 5 minutes are the best for enhancing what you've learned. [IMPORTANT] no attaching yourself to a screen. No screen territory.

**How many hours one should study.** Research has shown that successful students study between 6 and 8 hours in addition to classes. Less than average study 2-5 hours a day.

**Earmuffs are a game-changer**. Recently I've tried them on and since then as soon as I sit in front of my obsidian or to read a book I put them on and stay focused no matter what. I supplemented music with silence. In the end, the best music is silence. For tasks that don't require intensive thinking I still use music as a concentration medium. Music cuts off external sounds and let me focus on typing or doing routine work.

Another question that can help deepen understanding and maybe knowledge, “Why am I doing this?”

Useful steps to start **decompressing process towards sleep**: write to-do for the next day, review your notes by composing a daily note. This clears your mind. I couldn't understand why I like sleeping under a heavy blanket, so the answer is easy, weighted blankets improve sleep and can put me to sweet oblivion much faster.

**Reviewing notes** is also could be an excellent process for crystallizing gathered knowledge. And don't stop at your notes, if you can skim over notes that have been taken by your friend or other people online on the same topic. It could bring superb results and deepen understanding.

Chapter 8 is about motivation, nothing new, though might be useful in my future research.

And in the end, an awesome checklist of how to become an effective learner.
