Annotation:: Hadfield is a genius, a man of science and technology and no first-timer to the universe."-New York Post Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, and been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft. In his bestselling An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories, his vivid and refreshing insights will teach you how to think like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth-especially your own.

### Keep a specific attitude towards learning
- Sometimes you don‚Äôt know what you do and why. You just train, read, attend university and school.
	- The majority of people do it without giving the process any second thoughts.
	- That exactly what puts them behind those who do the same action consciously.
	- Every tiny piece of knowledge, skill you‚Äôve learned add something to the base you are building.
		- You might not use it ever in your life, but the amount you know sets you apart from those who don‚Äôt, and gives you a head start.
		- Another positive effect of learning while you can, is that it puts your feet on the ground and a knowing person is much harder to shake.
- The point of learning is simple learning and nothing else.
	- We learn for the sake of knowledge, and some day it might or might not save our life. The process is more important than the results.
- Learning is preparation, but not only in the risk managements domain, it is also about gaining knowledge of something that might add new risks and avoid it.
	- More often than not, we add risk unwittingly, we are the authors of our fates.
	- No need to write a tragedy or a catastrophe.

	- Who said that given premises are wrong or in conflict?
	- Or who said that they are valid?

- Keep in mind, that if something deemed to go wrong, it would go wrong. And you can‚Äôt do anything about. After all, the only guaranteed thing is a fuck-up. ^265e87
- Think negatively. Become a pessimist and figure what might cause you harm, not to dwell on it, but to plan and prevent it from happening.
	- Dwelling is the same as why. You constantly ask yourself and maybe doubt. In time of crisis, why is irrelevant.
	- [[Ideas/Antifragile book 6.md#^f1a743]]

### Intelligence in an early age dangerous thing
- Early success is a terrible teacher.
	- In a sense, you are rewarded for not preparing. Thus, when you find yourself in a situation where preparation is needed, you can‚Äôt do it. Because you still operate from the premise that no preparation is needed.
	- It happens to every talented student. When he must prepare, he doesn‚Äôt know how to do it in the first place.
		- There is no such thing as being over prepared for something.

### Plan mundane tasks ahead of time
- Often when we discuss the consequences of certain actions, we tend to fall into talking about extremely vague and nice sounding proclamations.
	- Like: Peace around the world, or happiness to everyone and don‚Äôt let anyone walk away hurt.
	- This high speech omits the essential stuff, like actions.
	- When I get to school, I will culturally enrich children.
		- How ridiculous!

			- The work of a foreman much more important than the work of a manager.
- [[Books/Nudge - Richard H Thaler Cass R Sunstein.md#Plan B is what matters, nothing else]]
	- Remember to have a contingency plan too.

### Subtraction of abilities
- Better to remember that subtraction is better than addition.
- Though, here we can talk a bit deeper.
	- When I‚Äôd managed the most effective team of regional directors in one gas and oil company, I always divided people to several categories and on two levels.
- The basic level is the level of execution.
	- A perpetrator. A guy who does the task, no question asked.
	- A thinker. A guy how thinks before acting and, if the solution is not optimal, voices doubt and sometimes just does what he considers best under the current circumstances.
- Advanced level. On this level, I usually decide about future cooperation.
	- Minus. An employee who is constantly in opposition.
	- Zero. A person who is balancing between agreeing with everything and opposing everything. Speaks his mind and gives reason behind ideas.
	- Plus. The most agreeable worker on the grounds. Does whatever he is told to, without second thought.
	- In my line of work, healthy dissent has always been good, opposition, and conformism bad.
		- Conformist and opposition cost money, time and effort. You must get rid of obstacles. Keep zeroes around.
- When a new guy lands in a team, he should consider himself a zero.
	- Not show off because if he shows off, thinking that he knows or can do better, he instantly gets minus to his karma and becomes minus one, actively harmful and viewed by everyone as a walking problem.
	- Zeroes are those who just do their work at the limits of their abilities.
	- Plus ones, are promoted zeroes. Promotion comes from silent action, no need for showing off.

### Silence is gold, but not the way everyone thinks
- When your tenure finished, and you have an opportunity to input some value to a meeting, remember that there is always a golden possibility to keep your mouth shut.
	- When you are famous enough, people tend to listen to you more closely than they actually should, so keeping quiet is the best way.
	- Though, it doesn‚Äôt mean that your focus of attention should be somewhere.
	- Be focused on what is unfolding in front of you, be vigilant about blunders people might put themselves and if the mistake isn‚Äôt corrected by the end of the meeting, help them.
	- Remember that polished solutions might spring up from utterly wrong assumptions, help people in avoiding such.
