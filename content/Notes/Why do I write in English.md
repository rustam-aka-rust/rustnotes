## Why do I write in English

- Why are most of the notes in English? I can only assume that this is the most common question arising from readers.
- The true reasons for this lie on several planes.
    - First, I am an English instructor, and I need to continually refine my language skills.
        - Achieving this in school is nearly impossible. Or, to put it differently, I have to use simple words with students and avoid intricate and ambiguous vocabulary.
    - Second, most books that find their way onto my digital shelf are in English.
        - Itâ€™s inconvenient to translate them into my native language. We will discuss the topic of native language later.
        - In short, I am indolent, and thinking in one language is already demanding enough.
    - Lastly, regardless of opinions, the English language is simply more beautiful and more straightforward for conveying thoughts, concepts, and ideas.

> I am bilingual. I was born in Baku, so naturally, I speak Azerbaijani and partially Turkish. Everyone in my family spoke and still speaks Russian. Additionally, I attended an English boarding school back in the day. I honestly can't determine which language feels more native to me. So, expect to see notes in both English and Russian.
