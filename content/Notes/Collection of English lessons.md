> It’s due time I made something like this in my Digital Garden. As many of my loyal readers know, the majority of my notes are [[Why do I write in English|written in English]], but they remain hidden from prying eyes and continue to be my place for thinking. Everything that you can find here, in different sections of this website, is a polished product of my thought process, so enjoy it.
