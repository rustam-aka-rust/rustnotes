## Sequential notes
Sequential notes are easier to follow when working on an idea and they highlight the flow of thoughts.

I can draw at least to benefits from this approach:
1. Ideas are consistent.
2. Easier to develop a topic.

Though there is at least one disadvantage, sequential note-taking requires more thinking time.

### Conclusive Argument for Sequential Notes
- Ideas are easier to follow, and it's simpler to draw conclusions from them.
	- Instead of the "flowers," as I referred to them during my stream with [[Sonke Ahrens]], I now have a stream. Just take a look [[How do I see the goal of education|at the example]].
		- It's structured in a one-way manner, but backlinks are easy to follow. There's no need to worry about forgetting something.
- There's one more thing worth mentioning.
	- The most critical aspect isn't how the notes are organized but your ability to derive value from them.
	- Possible outcomes include:
		- Short instructions to oneself, e.g., how to conduct a [[Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes are High|crucial conversation]], or assembling a toolbox for [[Argumentation Theory|effective argumentation]], among other things.
