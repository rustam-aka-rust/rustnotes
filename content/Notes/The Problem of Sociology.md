- **Truly valuable experiments are impossible.**
	- This is because anything we do in sociology is not experimental in the strictest sense of the word.
	- Social experimentation differs fundamentally from experiments in physics.
	- Sociology does not serve as a means to produce knowledge on a large scale but often operates for political purposes.
		- I believe Ariely might disagree with this, but these ideas contain a kernel of truth.
	- Experimentation has been extracted from sociology due to the way such studies are conducted.
		- Rather than working with isolated variables, the elements interact freely in the external world, altering it through their own actions.
	- New points of tension introduce a degree of novelty at the heart of the experiment.
		- Consequently, new conditions emerge. While in physics, the rearrangement of established elements leads to different outcomes, we cannot claim that newly arranged elements in social experiments can genuinely be considered the same as their previous forms.
		- Interaction transforms them irrevocably.
		- In a scenario where nothing can be replicated exactly, the term "isolated conditions" loses its meaning, and genuine novelty arises.
		- So, how do we experiment under such conditions? The brief answer is, we can’t. Yet humanity endures regardless.
	- Since the true isolation of sociological elements is unattainable, we are confronted with a dual complexity:
		- A complexity stemming from the inability to truly isolate participants in the experiment.
		- The inherent origin of social phenomena. These phenomena emerge from social life, which presupposes mental life, which, in turn, is grounded in biology, chemistry, and ultimately, physics.
		- So many intricate underlying processes shape social interaction. It’s extraordinarily complex.
	- Any prediction beyond this point becomes virtually impossible, yet humanity persists. ^84b945
		- The interconnected complexity of the system disrupts any initial predictions.
		- Simply put, prediction alters what is predicted.
		- The introduction of new information influences the situation, modifying the conditions it seeks to describe.
			- Whether this new information brings about the expected outcome or prevents it.
			- Popper termed this the “Oedipus Effect.”

- **Prediction is a social event.**
	- It may intersect with other social occurrences, and the predicted event might be among them.
	- When social scientists announce a prediction, they open up a realm of possibilities with diverse potential outcomes.
	- Some of these outcomes may not have been anticipated, and their impact on future developments remains unknown.

- **The holism of historical prediction.**
	- The social group is far more than the simple sum of its parts.
	- A+B differs from B+C, and A+B+C is distinct from both.
