## Information is a Surprise

- This is one of the qualities that I use to highlight the text.
	- As I used to call it, a surprise. The first time I stumbled upon this definition was in some long-forgotten book about information.
	- And it resonated so much that, since then, I consistently use this as a trigger for an annotation in the book.
	- A subsequent search directed me to Claude Shannon and his perspective on information theory, and it turns out it could be measured and predicted.
- Shannon went even further. Instead of merely calculating the line of symbols that conveys meaning, he devised a complex logarithmic equation, as far as I can comprehend. Which I am not going to delve into.
	- Instead of that, I go another way around. Shannon, too, avoided this treacherous slope of the concept of meaning.
		- Who can definitively say what is meaningful and what is not?
		- Let me give you an example of two sentences:
			- The Sun will rise tomorrow.
			- The world will end tomorrow.
		- The same number of words in both, but the meaning they convey differs significantly.
			- The first states a fact that is actually irrelevant, the second also states a fact that demands action.
			- *Maybe, just maybe, the amount of information that is conveyed could be measured by the action a person should take after receiving it?*
	- The thing is, we find a message, sentence, or statement informative based on whether it is news to us or not.
		- As I mentioned earlier, Shannon stayed clear of the concept of meaning and instead focused his attention on the emotional aspect of a surprise, which is also, in my opinion, challenging to quantify.
	- Imagine a person reading a news outlet. At some point, say in ten minutes of reading, his brows raise, and he delves deeper into the text. 
		- There is clearly something intriguing written or spread.
	- I read from the same premise. I don’t see prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, or articles, only who does what, and sometimes the conditions under which this action takes place.
		- I openly miss factual or declarative information and try looking into underlying information; for this work, eloquence is an obstacle.
		- Though I also use many words to deliver some message, I do it intentionally to provide context, as I am doing right now. But let's return to the topic of surprise.
		- Remember the guy who was reading a news outlet and his brows had risen? What did he read about?
	- Imagine that he sees in his text words such as a dog, a man, bites.
		- They are all high-frequency words, which means you can encounter them multiple times.
		- A man appears 61,145 times in more than 1 million texts[^1].
		- A dog appears 9,783 times in more than 55,000 texts[^2].
		- Bites appears 850 times in more than 1,300 texts[^3].
	- Among the three words, “bites” is the most surprising word because we come across it less frequently than with a man and a dog, but there is a nuance that we need to consider.
	- [[Predictability of the language is its key feature|If a dog bites a man]], it’s hardly news, but when a man bites a dog, it is indeed newsworthy.
- The combination of words plays a pivotal role in how much information the text holds.
	- We have to take into consideration the order of the words: which goes first and which word follows.
