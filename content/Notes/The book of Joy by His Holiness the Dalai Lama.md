## 📒 Ideas
`What is joy? Where it comes from? How to sustain it, during the lifetime? How not to feel miserable in the cruel world?`
- According to this book, there are 8 pillars of joy.
	- 4 pillars of the mind.
	- 4 pillars of the heart.

- Discovering joy doesn’t save you from injustices, hardships and heartbreaks.
	- What it does, joy allows you to cry more easily and to laugh more easily.
	- As we discover more joy we can face suffering in a way that ennobles us instead of embitters.
		- Fight hardships without becoming hard.
		- Break heart without being broken.

### Meditation Sevenfold analysis #practice by Dalai Lama
- It is contemplative practice. Where you search the true nature of the self by analyzing the relationship between physical and mental aspects of the body and mind.
	- I can see body, but not trueself. I can see the mind, but not the trueself of the person.
	- So where is this person that I am looking at? Who is he in truth? ^6898dc
	- But we can’t find this person We have to constantly look for, ask question, is it truly him or not? What do I miss.
		- *It’s similar to the notion, when we look at the work of a famous person, we can’t know what has been done before. How this image of a person was  forged. We only see a facade not the realself who accomplished something.*

- Nowadays, too many people pay attention to what outside, not to what inside. 
	- The source of happy life lies not somewhere but within.
	- [Look up in my thesis on critical problems of humanity] About how we switched real joy of being oneself to the pretense of being somebody else.

#practice 
- When you are in the middle, of some negative experience and if there is no way to overcome it, then there is no way worrying too much. Change your attitude. ^21739e

	- An experiment showed that sad people are more motivated, more sensitive to needs of social group and more generous than happier control group.
- Sadness directed to oneself inevitably leads to despair and depression. Focus not on yourself but on the person you are sad about or even greaving.

- The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.

- The same as [[Peter Watts]] told during numerous interviews, optimists don’t survive long to share their genome. Humans are irreversibly pessimistic.

- In a face of great adversity, we usually experience more joy, it makes life seemingly easier. [[Свобода от одних ограничений накладывает другие]] look closely to Junger’s Freedom, maybe he has more sound arguments. Especially where he wrote about war.

	- Survived only those who focused on the current tasks, without waiting anything else to happen.
