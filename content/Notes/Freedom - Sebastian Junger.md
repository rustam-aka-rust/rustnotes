## 📒 Ideas
### Freedom is nothing more than obedience
- There is no real freedom, we constantly owe something to somebody.
	- First parents to be obedient in the nursery school, then to them again at school, but we also have obligation to bring good marks.
	- After school, university comes into play and to finish in successfully we have to sacrifice personal time and space for graduation. It doesn’t mean that it must become obsession [[Эта странная жизнь - Гранин Д#Obsession in science can lead to drastic consequences]], but nonetheless, you pay the price.
	- And the price is that we are not free, we have to pay and repay.
- In a sense, we trade obedience to one person for obedience to another. 
	- Such a life.
