Summary:
Last week, MIF contacted me and asked if I fancy setting up a book club discussion about a recently published book. 

With the following commentary, that it is the second best-selling book in the UK since Harry Potter. To be honest, it has been an intriguing comment. 

So, the next thing is me buying the Kindle edition of the book, the publisher sending me a Russian translation and in the end I’ve managed to squeeze it between chapters of Dettmer’s Logical thinking process. And now have an opinion to share. 

What can I say, it is in no way Harry Potter. I don’t understand where such hype is coming from, but nonetheless, it was pleasant ten hours of reading. 

And it might be possible to think of some interesting book club discussions, games and other pastime activities around the book, characters and setting. 

No details on the plot though, you want to know what’s all the fuss about? Buy and read it yourself. All I can say, not bad, but also nothing special.
