## Field-Dependent and Field-Independent Note-Takers

- This is an interesting concept, the dependency on a field where students find themselves.
    - We are rarely in our elements when we learn something new. Usually, it's a new field or domain, and we can be a clean slate or have some knowledge. However, the way we manipulate ideas is crucial for understanding.
- Typically, the majority of notes that I see are verbatim or close to it—transcriptions of the speech or even the book.
    - I think it is the fear of missing something important that forces us to write word for word, which is okay, but it doesn’t create space for thinking.
    - We load our cognition with only one function: to take notes without thinking.
    - The note-taker soothes himself with the thought that later he can review his notes and think deeper about the contents and ideas.
        - But it doesn’t happen. We are rarely engaged in a meaningful process of reviewing. We just aren't used to it or simply don’t know how it’s done.
    - This makes us field-dependent note-takers.
- Independence in note-taking comes with indifference to the words used in the text or by a speaker.
    - They are not important; the idea that they describe is, and only it is important enough to spend effort on thinking.
    - Better to write less but in your own words than a lot with someone else’s.
    - It’s called field-independent note-taking. When we use our words instead of the given ones, we are engaged in the process of decoding and encoding information.
    - We abstract and order ideas in our notes the way we see fit, not the way someone else sees fit.
- This plays a key role in [[Increasing the Efficacy of Notes for Later Review|the reviewing process]]. The thing is, when we sit before notes that are independent of the field and meaningful to us, we have half-done the work; the only thing left is to think about how ideas are connected.
    - Build a network or better, a situational model from the ideas we captured.
    - By the way, it is a [[Model of reading the information by the demanding reader. How he sees every text.canvas|situational model]]. I already see how this concept works and how I can better explain whatever we do in [[План урока - Перефразирование|paraphrasing class]].
