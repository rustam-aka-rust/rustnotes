## To-Do Lists Are Much Less Efficient Than Note-Taking About Completed Tasks

- This idea has plagued me for a long time. I’ve been thinking about the [[Essentialism The Disciplined Pursuit of Less#A paradox of Busyness|philosophy of busyness]] that spreads like a disease among intellectual workers.
	- And as a consequence, there's a desire to do more in less time, rather than focusing on what’s truly important and not just what seems important.
	- But in all my struggles, I couldn’t find the right tool for implementing note-taking in a productivity system.
	    - Though I’ve got plenty of tips, for example, [[Эта странная жизнь - Гранин Д|from Lubychev]].
	    - Who had been journaling all his life.
	    - I even explained to everyone I met that note-taking is a place for thinking. Any intellectual worker should have one.
	- The answer, as usual, is a combination and [[Mental models (thinking maps)|reinterpretation]] of a great idea.
	    - Pomodoro is the simplest tool to boost productivity, but it lacks one crucial element: reflection, though it has the potential to incorporate one.
	    - So now, we see how it could be tweaked to accommodate both productivity enthusiasts and office workers with multiple projects.
	- All my life, I’ve thought of to-do lists as a waste of time; even now, I don’t have one.
	    - Instead of tracking to-dos, I journal. I literally track my work with a journal entry. Even this one is nothing more than a journal entry, but it can have a much more structured view. Though an outliner provides a semblance of structure.
	    - In my case, journaling happens when I move from one publication to another.
	        - I mean when I finish a paper.
	    - In an office, it should happen when transitioning between projects or tasks.
	        - A few sentences are more than enough. The entry must have two points:
	            - *What you have done.*
	            - *What you are going to do.*
	        - The point of transition is a moment of finishing the previous big task and the beginning of the next.
	            - Checked email, or read working chat.
	            - Left the meeting with the CEO or a team.
	            - Finished writing a document.
