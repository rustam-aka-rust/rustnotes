## Superordinate and Subordinate Sets of Ideas on the Mind Map

- I’ve never thought about the concept of mind maps, and it actually has its merits.
    - Everything we put on it has a place and role. The first nodes that spur from the central axis are the superordinate ideas and concepts, to which we later add elements.
    - But we were reading the map incorrectly. I didn’t know this.
- If we look at any map, we can notice that when the map is read vertically, the reader grasps the interconnectedness of an aspect of the phenomenon.
- When we read horizontally, we observe the connection between different aspects within a phenomenon.
    - Students are good at catching the superordinate ideas that are placed on the vertical axis.
    - But without repetition, the horizontal axis will be full of holes and missing ideas.
    - Within the text, it’s not so difficult to implement repetition; I mean, just read the text again, or if you’ve already marked keywords, look at them and try seeing what else you missed.
- Matrices and mind maps force students to take field-independent notes, which play a significant role in comprehension. Let me give you an example from a case study.
