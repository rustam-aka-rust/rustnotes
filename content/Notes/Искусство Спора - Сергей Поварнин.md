## 📒 Ideas
### Main thing in any argument
- It is essential to understand that argument, without clear goal in mind is useless affair.
	- The main goals for any argument are only these two.
		- Validating personal position.
		- Invalidating opponent’s position.
	- For this we have to set up a clear thesis of the argument. ^bb7e4f
		- In a way that it both understood and accepted.
		- To do this, three steps are often enough, but not everyone goes this length.
		- 1. All words in the statement hold same meaning for opposing sides.
		- 2. Next step would be the drawing of the borders.
			- Are we talking about all objects that are included in the category of the argument, or some portion of it.
			- Like, assertion that “All people are evil”.
			- Is it really all, or only some of them?
			- This point often is called defining the quantifiers of the thesis.
		- 3. And the last comes our attitude towards thesis.
			- Do we accept it as false or true, or maybe partially true or partially false.
			- Level of certainty is also of importance.
			- Possible or impossible, etc. 
			- This last point is called modality of the argument.
				- This is what we really mean when we speak about attitude towards argument.

### On evidence and argumentation and connection between one and the other
- Several conditions must be fulfilled for a successful resolution of a dispute.
	- First and foremost, the point of an argument must be valid for both sides.
	- Statements of arguments and counterarguments should be done simply and clearly.
		- Act according to the Occam’s razor. [[Critical thinking#Occam’s razor principle]]
	- The most crucial point is the existence of the connection between the topic of the debate and arguments.
		- If there is no connection between the two, then there is nothing to prove.
		- Thought it couldn’t be seen as obvious, subtle also works.

#### Mistakes in proof can happen
- Usually there is three main suspects.
	- In thesis itself. Sometime the topic of the argument saying the least controversial.
	- In Argument. When we prove from the false premise or with the help of random argument that needs to be proved itself.
	- And in the connection between one and another. As I’ve mentioned it is the most crucial point, the connection between the topic and the arguments.
