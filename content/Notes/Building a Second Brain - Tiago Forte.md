## üìí Ideas

	- It was continuous effort to make sense of the world. Reading and writing back them had been inseparable.
- Not so long ago during the meeting in [[–§–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–æ—Ñ–µ–π–Ω—è —É –°–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ –°–ï–ó–û–ù 2 –°–∞–º—É—Ä–∞–∏ –∏ –ú–æ–Ω–∞—Ö]] we discussed with Sergei Baranov a little note-taking and when I told him about my threefold reading technique, he stated that the third reading equals to writing your own book.

### School learning nowadays
- Something disposable, with no intention of using it in the future.
	- No long term attitude towards school knowledge.

### In addition to critical thinking
- We can say that writer's block is a form of barrier for critical thinking.
	- As we speculated, [[Critical thinking could not be taught]] it‚Äôs absence of information what prevents us from thinking properly and writing engagingly.
	- Thus, writer‚Äôs block is not inability to write something, it‚Äôs lack of information, not deep and extensive enough research.

### How to choose what to highlight
- Does it inspire me?
	- A piece of information that hits the spark or some emotion.

### Knowledge is applied practice
- If any piece of information doesn‚Äôt help you with progress then it detracts you from it.

### Attitude towards PKM
[[–°–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –±–∞–∑—ã –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π]]

- Mix and remix.
	- Easy concept, don‚Äôt borrow the whole pieces, only bits and exempts from articles, make what you‚Äôve taken into universal things. [[–ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–ø —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏]], the deeper universality, the more options you get. 
	- Atomic notes are the best. [[–ó–∞–º–µ—Ç–∫–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ –±—ã—Ç—å –∞—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ä–Ω–æ–π]]

### Knowledge workers dilemma
- The need to find balance between quality and quantity.
	- We need to be able to deliver high quality at a steady rate.
	- Say one piece a week. For that we have to research, analyze, compile and publish. If we are talking about blog or writing a book.
	- All our stuff must be well organized, and be ready for use.
	- Same principle that successful chef are using. Mise-en-Place.
- The reason it is hard for a modern knowledge worker to find that balance has been vividly described by Cal Newport.
