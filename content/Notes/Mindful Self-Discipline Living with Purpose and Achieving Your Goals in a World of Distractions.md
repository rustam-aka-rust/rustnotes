## ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes

## üìí Ideas
### Don‚Äôt confuse discipline with control
- I couldn‚Äôt understand at first why it‚Äôs so difficult to grasp the notion of discipline. 
	- It‚Äôs easy, self-imposed restrictions give enormous scale of freedom to do what I really need and what I really want.
	- But most people couldn‚Äôt see this simple dichotomy. Why?
	- Because they confused self-control with self-discipline. 
	- They are not the same.
- Everything around us designed to break self-discipline.
	- Distract us from goals and aspirations.
	- Social networks, messengers, groups and small talks.

### Why mindful self-discipline?

	- Motivation doesn‚Äôt play any role here, it‚Äôs just a word.
	- To do day after day what you need to do doesn‚Äôt require motivation, only determination, commitment, and discipline.

### Pillars of a life
- What are pillars of my life?
	- Around what I am building all activities?
	- What goals do I pursue?
- In case of the book, they are:
	- Personal growth (meditation and spirituality)
	- Family (wife and daughter)
	- Legacy (work)
- What are mine?
	- Mine differ a bit, but not too much, obviously family is there, and work also exists, but in what volume?
	- Self-discipline is universal to all domains and aspirations.
- Pillars must align with goals and habits you pursue. And it‚Äôs a matter of wisdom, not discipline.

	- [[–≤—ã–±–æ—Ä –∏ —Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ]]
	- Not everyone understands the difference, the same is fair for this book too.

	- Lack of recourses is not a big enough obstacle to stop us.
		- Money, time, support, effort, internal strength, they are externals.
		- What is really lacking is a deep commitment and self-discipline.
		- Will to act day in and day out no matter what.

### Disciplined life is a life of a monk not a soldier

>‚Äî *HARVEY DORMAN*

> ‚Äî *Mark Twain*

- Why do we want these habits?
	- Is it because everyone doing them, or we really wish them?
	- Do they align with your core values?
	- *Task one.*
	- The list of values is really endless, but here are some examples from the book.
		- ![[–°–Ω–∏–º–æ–∫ —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ 2022-09-14 –≤ 05.41.55.png]]

	- Thereafter, take a careful look about answers and describe a person who has just answered the questions. One precise sentence.
		- Keep in mind that you are describing an abstract person, not the real person sitting in front of you on a screen.

			- Nerdy questions. 
			- So what? 
			- Why?
	- By doing this (*asking five why*(s)), we are looking for emergent phenomenon. ^01eb27
		- Not often we can understand or explain ourselves where the wish comes from.

			- Do not look at what they are doing, you may have no resources.

	- *Task four*
	- Building your identity. ^751f0d
	- Aspirations are not about actions, they are about changing. ^28c61e

		- There is nothing motivational about it, only inspirational.
	- At this stage, we decide who do we want to be, and later we can choose the route we are the most comfortable with.

		- [[How to Think Like a Roman Emperor - Donald J Robertson#^952576]]
	- In short, meditate.

### If you think that you can‚Äôt go anymore, you are wrong
- Fatigue, usually hits what you expended only 40% of your resources.
	- Which means that at the first sign of tiredness you can go further at least twice as long.
	- This state is true for any line of work: mental, physical, psychological, etc.
- The grit to continue is a question of habits and willpower to go the whole mile.
	- Discipline is not about just habits of doing something, it is about inseparable trio: *habits, willpower, wisdom* (to know what you really want).

### No aspirations, welcome boredom and tediousness
- As I‚Äôve mentioned in [[–°–∫—É–∫–∞ –∏ –ª—é–±–æ–ø—ã—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–æ]] if the feeling of boredom doesn‚Äôt leave us at work or school, it happens only because we ask the wrong questions.
	- Questions that don‚Äôt spark curiosity.
- This is equally fair for aspirations.
	- When you have nothing to aspire to, your life is devoid of drive and engagement.
	- And we replace it with bad habits, look for entertainment in all the wrong places, such as social media, games, etc.
	- *We all need to know that we are moving somewhere.*

### Instant gratification VS delayed gratification
- Modern life stimulates a person to change long-term gains, for short-term gains.
	- Our brain prefers comfort of picture browsing than effort of text reading.
	- Pictures are easier to understand than text.
- Striving for long-term gains is a search for fulfillment, which follows with a transcend moment of higher level bliss.
	- Maslow also considered this from the point of view of basic needs.
		- Why do we need to satisfy all levels of needs?
		- To ascend the highest possible level of achievement and experience peak moments of one‚Äôs life. *Flow, inspiration, daily gratitude, experiences of awe.*
		- [[–û –ø–∏—Ä–∞–º–∏–¥–µ –ú–∞—Å–ª–æ—É]]

### Be aware of where you are
- No amount of motivational videos can help with achieving goals.
	- The only thing that matters is awareness of current condition.
		- Where am I?
		- What do I do, that I do?
		- Why do I do this?
	- Otherwise, a person, without clear view of where, what and why, lives life on autopilot,
	- The only possible way to understand and comprehend conditions is to pause and intentionally switch the tumbler into different position.
		- Only after that, you can move for a change.
		- Imagine that all your life you were riding in a car and never walking out of it.
		- At some point you got in it, my bet it was done sometime after university or in the last years of university.
		- And since that moment you have been driving relentlessly through life. First work, change of career, marriage, kids, school, kid‚Äôs problem, tough moments of relationship, you‚Äôve got the picture.
		- Your car has seen smooth roads and much tougher terrains, but have you seen the condition of your car? No, you are locked inside, and your attention is only on the road.
		- You have to stop the car (pause), exit it, and contemplate what happen to it after long years of exploitation and neglect. Neglect it is.
		- To conduct an inventory shop has to stop working, the same is fair here.
			- We have to conduct an inventory of our values, aspirations, action, and wishes.
			- And keep the tab of actions +1 to actions that get me closer to aspirations, -1 to actions that stir away from them.
[[–û—Å–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≤–∞–π –≥–¥–µ —Ç—ã –µ—Å—Ç—å]]

### We are people of habits
- Through life we accumulate habits, and they become the defining element of individuality.
	- Habits are what we are and nothing else.
	- [[–°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–æ —Ü–µ–ª–µ–π#^da4072]]
	- Thus, an idea that changing them is a heavy burden, doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe the real state of affairs.
		- Changing or introducing a new one is like swimming against the current or rebelling against one‚Äôs nature.
		- New habits, and ridding of bad ones, require time and effort.
		- To implements the change, the feeling of purpose is extremely needed. Which is easily acquired through our work with aspirations. [[#^28c61e]]
		- If they are not translated into action and after that into habits they won‚Äôt be fulfilled.

### Types of habits
- Action habits.
	- Something you need to do day after day. Like going for a jog, or keeping track of your meetings, to regularly reflect about the past day.
- Replacement habits.
	- This one is aimed at changing a harmful habit. It requires forceful intervention of conscious mind to register the cue and becoming aware of it to reject the urge.
- Project habits.
	- What you work on something a bit, like starting a blog, or taking systematic notes.
	- It demands breaking habit into small acts of will, during a specific period of time. Like process, all notes from previous day from 5 to 7 am.

### Starting a habit
- Cueing.
	- Spend a few minutes thinking about cues for the next three habits you want to create.
	- Take steps to implement them right now.
	- Think about the order of habits if it is relevant.
	- And be ready to spend some willpower on it.
	- Examples.
		- *When I enter my study, I turn on a table lamp, and begin working immediately.*
		- *When I enter the bedroom, I leave the phone in the corridor.*
		- *Leave a pen and paper ready on the table, start writing as soon as you hit the chair.*
- Environment.
	- It‚Äôs important, as I‚Äôve aforementioned before, building systems is much more effective than creating behavioural patterns.
		- We need to create an environment for successful implementation of habits.
		- *No social media apps on the smartphone.*
		- *No cakes at or pastry at home.*
		- *I turned off all notification from my smartphone.*
	- Make a list of five changes that you can do today in your environment.
- Audit doubts.
	- We constantly doubt ourselves. Otherwise, we would have already implemented any habit.
	- And doubts kill everything. Doubt kills more aspirations than failure ever will.
	- Pause for a moment. Take a deep breath, and honestly answer the next questions.
		- How am I doubting my ability to achieve the goal of making a sustainable habit?
		- In what way am I doubting my chosen strategy?
		- Do I doubt my purpose and aspirations? In what way?

### Keeping on track
- It‚Äôs not possible to be on top of your ability all the time.
	- Occasionally, you‚Äôll be under the weather: tired, ill, annoyed, competing priorities, distractions, outright failures and dissatisfaction.
	- Wish to drop everything swarm over your head.
	- Under this condition, it is critical to have a contingency plan.
		- Which in a sense is if/then algorithm. *If smth happens,*
		- To accomplish this, you have to make a list of challenges you might face.
		- Then below each item an action must be put. It should be as concise and as precise as possible. No need for extra words. *I will do this.*
		- That‚Äôs not enough, the list must necessary be internalized, memorized, and you have to get comfortable with it.
