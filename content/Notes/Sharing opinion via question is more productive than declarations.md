## Sharing Opinions via Questions is More Productive Than Declarations

- Declarative knowledge is not knowledge at all. You can reflect on something, but to proclaim that you know for certain that this fact is this and that something should be done like this, is at least presumptuous.
	- Everything changes and shifts.
	- Don’t think in terms of opinions and reactions, worries and hopes, or satisfactions and regrets.
	- Consider the things that precede those feelings, opinions, and regrets.
		- Only by thinking about the reasons behind a certain event can we understand its consequences.
- As soon as someone says something, instead of simply agreeing with it, begin with questions.
	- *What does it mean?*
	- *Is it consistent?* Does it change under different conditions? 
		- This is a challenging question that needs to be considered beforehand. One must think beyond existing premises.
			- Similar to the question in [[The Art of Systems thinking#Look outside the frame|three mistakes]].
	- *What did you mean by that?*
	- Socrates often asks leading questions that leave his partner with no room for evading answers:
		- *Isn’t it true that …?*
		- *Wouldn’t you agree that …?*
- In essence, abandon any fixed position and adopt the attitude of an open book, where everything has value.
	- Refrain from forming a strong opinion on anything, even after reading a book written by an authority.
	- In return, the beliefs that remain will become more robust and well-founded.
- Such questioning should be done in small and gradual steps, chipping away at the issue.
	- It might seem as if the focus has shifted or it might become irritating, but we must put aside such notions and remain consistent in our inquiry. 
	- It will bear fruit.
