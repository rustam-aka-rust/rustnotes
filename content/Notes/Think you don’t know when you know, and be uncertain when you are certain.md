## Think you don’t know when you know, and be uncertain when you are certain

- We are *at our sharpest in thinking mode* when we work on a question, not after it’s answered.
	- This proves why it's so hard to come up with interesting questions, and why I often say that a [[Глупый вопрос|silly question]] is the best.
	- Try coming up with one: How does a woodpecker’s tongue work, why is the air transparent, but the sky is blue? ^a4e486
- The practitioner of the Socratic method is comfortable with what he doesn’t know, but even more comfortable doubting what he thinks he knows.
	- His greatest struggle is the search for value. Reading and note-taking might be substitutes for the Socratic method.
	- First of all, because we constantly challenge the writer of the idea.
	- Challenging oneself follows the first point. So yes, [[my note-taking system|note-taking]] is the Socratic questioning of oneself and the author.
- The most pressing problem for non-practitioners of the Socratic method is that they are often certain when they shouldn’t be and think that they know something they don’t.
	- The philosophy of Socrates that encapsulates his method isn’t a set of beliefs that can be easily transferred. *It’s an activity*, just as note-taking is an activity, so is the Socratic method.
		- The [[Мышление ведет к мыследеятельности|thinking activity]] that has been covered by Schedrovitsky is one of the Stoic [[Дисциплины стоиков|disciplines]].
	- The method has an impact on your opinion; it doesn’t simply replace one idea with another, though that might happen during the execution of elements of the method.
	- What it actually does is build tolerance for testing what you believe.
	- The practitioner changes his relationship with personal opinions; to him, they become just one of many possible explanations.
