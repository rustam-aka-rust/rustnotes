## Implement Simple Heuristics to Increase Classroom Engagement

- As I previously mentioned, we don’t require much to enhance the overall disposition of students toward the teacher and the material being presented to them.
	- The only thing separating students from their studies and distractions, such as gadgets, is interest and an innate sense of curiosity—something an experienced teacher knows how to harness effectively.
- Sustaining **high energy** in the classroom is perhaps the most challenging heuristic, as it involves the orchestration of three complex mechanisms.
	- **Physical activity**, which goes beyond simple finger exercises to lift fatigue from writing, entails meaningful movement within the classroom. This could involve transitioning between tables, passing objects like a talking ball, or even activities that require students to stand and sit.
		- Research has demonstrated that similar regions of the brain are activated during both physical activity and the learning process.
		- Moreover, physical movement boosts oxygen levels and improves blood circulation, contributing to cognitive function.
	- The next point can be difficult for novice teachers: **pacing the lesson**.
		- A teacher must possess a deep understanding of the relationship between their instructions and the students’ responses.
		- When managing lesson pacing and planning activities, the teacher should avoid abrupt transitions between tasks, provide clear but not overly detailed instructions, and, above all, minimize interruptions.
		- The transition between the instructional phase and the action phase should be smooth and timely; otherwise, students can lose focus and become disengaged.
			- Students should be trained to respond instinctively to specific cues.
			- In my case, I use a clap or a sharp whistle to recapture attention.
		- A well-paced lesson ensures sustained attention from the students.
	- The third crucial factor is providing sufficient yet restrained information to stimulate curiosity. This concept pertains to **missing information**, which plays a pivotal role in capturing students' attention.
		- Humans are naturally drawn to puzzles and riddles. We often engage in solving them even when they bear no direct relevance to our values or practical concerns.
		- These challenges tap into our sense of curiosity and anticipation, which some researchers refer to as "appetitive states"—states that promote mental engagement.
		- According to the theory of clozentropy, such states activate the brain's attention centers.
			- Taylor, in 1953, developed a test to assess English proficiency that presents sentences with omitted information:
			- q Bill went to the ------- to buy some ------- to put on his cereal ------- they were out of stock.
			- The missing words here are: store, milk, and but.
				- Any student with a B1-2 English proficiency level can fill in these blanks effortlessly.
			- The root of this phenomenon lies in cybernetics theory:
				- The sentence activates a goal-seeking mechanism inherent in all humans. We are constantly striving to reconcile the gap between our expectations and actual outcomes.
				- This is a key element I utilize when teaching [[The Unexpected idea about skimming|skimming techniques]].
					- I instruct students to anticipate how the author thinks and then verify their predictions, which significantly enhances their engagement with the text and deepens their comprehension.
				- Missing information is notoriously difficult for humans to overlook.
	- Just as we are captivated by puzzles, we also value the freedom of choice, which ties into the **self-I** concept and manifests in our ability to make [[Блоки фундамента принятого решения|decisions that resonate]] with us personally.
		- This principle is a cornerstone of game design, where it is used to prolong player engagement.
		- The ability to make decisions—whether well-informed or not—is a key aspect of effective design.
			- This applies equally to the design of a lesson or a game.
		- The decisions individuals make, whether in games or in the classroom, are guided by two components of the self-I concept:
			- Personal and unique background knowledge, including:
				- Memories.
				- Experiences.
				- Desires.
				- Pleasures.
				- Pains.
			- And a hierarchy of goals.
				- Of which an individual is only partially aware.
				- These goals develop incrementally over the years.
			- Together, these factors form a [[The stories that we tell ourselves construct identity|person’s identity]].
				- They are the stories we tell ourselves, deeply embedded in our cognition and even in our DNA.
	- Two additional strategies that teachers can employ to engage students are **mild pressure** and **subtle controversy**.
		- Mild pressure can take the form of a timer on the screen or Socratic questioning.
			- [[Why invite Socrates into the classroom?|Socratic questioning]] encourages deeper thinking and exploration.
			- Students often feel anxious about being called on by the teacher, which can have the positive effect of heightening their attention.
			- One last technique, which I seldom use due to my impatience, is allowing sufficient wait time for an answer. The average wait time between posing a question and receiving an answer should be about 3 seconds.
		- Controversy, on the other hand, has a more nuanced purpose: to provoke **divergent thinking** around an opinion or issue.
			- Controversy challenges students to resolve discrepancies and engage in discussion. This can evolve into a debate or even begin as one.
