### ☘️ How the Book Changed Me
- I’ve organized 8 hours workshop how to build an identity.
	- With time it has evolved into something that could be sold as an online course.
	- [[Identity course]]

> How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.

## ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes
- Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future. 
- The best way is to always stop when you are doing good. Hemingway.
## 📒 Ideas
Tiny improvements build up to substantial results. The curve of 1% everyday increase demonstrated 300 increase in a year.

### System oriented habits
- Focus on systems and not goals, the same way as Naval used to mention in his book. [[Системы вместо целей]] ^3b28b6
	- The purpose of a goal is to win on a short streak, but the purpose of the system is to continue to play after winning or losing.
		- It's not about one accomplishment but constant refinement. Commitment to the process.
- In the recent talk with [[Дмитрий Эдерман]] we’ve discussed the problem of system, and he shared some ideas about it. ^5065ff
	- They were actually mind-blowing. I had never given any thought to this approach before.
	- So if we look at the system as a groundwork on which pillars are standing. [[Mindful Self-Discipline Living with Purpose and Achieving Your Goals in a World of Distractions#Pillars of a life]]
	- The system that we need to build is a complicated tangle of 4 subsystems. As I see them: *Physical space, digital space, health, thinking.* ^f81b07
		- The tangle will turn itself into a complex interconnected working system only after some effort has been applied to entanglement.
		- Actually, I’ve recently come up with an idea of how a complex system works. We start building from the bottom and move up. The first element is physical space, after that stage enters digital space, and when we dealt with spaces we have to take health into careful consideration, which in turn leads us to the modality of thinking.
			- What do we think when we interact with physical and digital space. What thought we are thinking when we take care of our body.
			- Thinking stands atop the summit for systemic construct and and penetrates in an arrow like manner all other layers.
			- [[Elements of the system where a human functions.excalidraw]]
	- So to change in any way your habits, you have to somehow improve one or several features of the system.
	- In the end it may come to disruption of existing system. [[#All innovation require disruption]].
	- To build something, you have to demolish something. 
	- Difficult to plant and cultivated, the occupied soil.
		- [[все инновации нуждаются в дизрупции]]
	- There is another issue we need to tackle. If the system is built upon something that is dependent on the outside features, the only certain outcome is a failure.
	- If we continue this line of thought, then we eventually come to the question, what are intrinsic elements of the system. 
	- Or what are intrinsic features of physical and digital space, health, and thinking.
	- The last one is definitely intrinsic, and how to change the existing thinking pattern is known to me. We even talk about collaborating with [[Максим Дорофеев]] about joint course on *logical thinking tools.*
	- What about first three?
		- Physical space. How to make it one way or another, internal feature?
		- What is it, physical space?
			- A place where I sit.
				- Space. Like a room, you are sitting in now.
				- Table.
				- Chair.
			- Tools I am using.
				- Laptop.
				- Keyboard.
				- Monitor.
				- Mouse.
				- Stack of cards to occupy my hands.
		- What happen if one or several of elements are missing. Like when I am not home? Does it crumble or continues functioning?
		- What happened when I travelled to Baku? Obviously, it didn’t help being away from my tools, but nonetheless, I continued to work and teach. With more distractions, but still work has been done, at least some.
		- Actually, I begin to think that physical is the most important of the four.
		- You can’t think in a noisy space, not at least you have a superpower of extreme concentration. Which, let’s be honest, not many have.
		- Change to a physical place comes at cost. What am I ready to sacrifice to become better?
		- Improvements of the space must follow the rules of [[Идеальный объект]]. *Functions of the object must be executed without an object.*
			- For this to work, we have to collide to contradictions of the system in the manner we have been doing in [[a tool for conflict resolution Evaporating cloud]].
			- A classic win-win situation. [[a tool for conflict resolution Evaporating cloud#Conflict resolution is not a win-lose situation]]

### Decision and choice
- There is an idea in the book that rhymes with Heidegger's notion of decision and choice. [[выбор и решение]]
	- Don't focus on the results, it leads to outcome-based habits. Not lasting.
	- Focus on details of who you are and who you want to become. Identity-based habits are for life.
		- Built intrinsic motivation, Habit must become part of your identity. You don't need to want it. You need to be it. Own it.

### All innovation require disruption
All innovation require disruption. To become the best version of yourself, you have to unlearn continuously, trim beliefs, expand and upgrade your identity (e.g., through reading).

- Four laws of behavior change: ^078277
	- Cue. Make it obvious.
	- Craving. Make in attractive.
	- Response. Make it easy.
		- Curious thing, identity and make it easy is not only about habits, but nudges.
		- It’s easy to do something that system allows you doing.
		- [[Books/Nudge - Richard H Thaler Cass R Sunstein.md#Plan B is what matters, nothing else]]
	- Reward. Make it satisfying.

- If you need to get rid of a bad habit, inverse statements above.
	- make it invisible.
	- make it unattractive.
	- make it hard to get.
	- make it excruciating.

### Audit your habits #howto 
Japanese system scorecards. State in voice what are you doing. Make a list and analyze it, with own mark system obvious marks are *= - +*
- Write all your activities from getting out of bed to getting dressed and drinking coffee, then rank all activities.

- If you want to integrate new habit. Make a plan. 
	- Formulate in as much details as you can. On [day]... I will [do]... in [place]...

Kurt Lewin [[Курт Левин о научной дискуссии]] I would like to read some of his thoughts, wrote equation about behavior: B is a function of the person in their Environment. `B=f(P,E)` You should remember that.

Self-control doesn't work. Systems work as was said before.

Life if a predictive, it actually feels reactive, when the phone rings we pick it up, when water boils we make some tea, but they are not reactions but predictions.
- We evaluate everything that happens to us and try to remember what happened before and what might happen in the future, we are deep in a guess work here. Endless prediction of what could happen at any given moment puts habits into action. Bad, good, neutral. Make things less changing and habits will follow suit.

> Make sure you see the difference between motion and action

- Motion is planning.
	- Outlining ideas for the article, YouTube video, lecture.
- Action is doing.
	- Writing the article, giving the lecture, filming the video.

Preparation can become a form of procrastination. No need for planning, you have to be practicing.
- Consistent habits are based not on the devoted time, but on the number of reps and frequency.

>Habits stick in a friction free environment.

- Take out from the equation, everything that makes habits difficult to follow. Snacks for dieting, notification for concentration, etc.
- Habits start long before action, some trigger, or cue begin the process we follow. Like calling a taxi or putting sport wear next to your chair in the study.
- As easy as possible. Choose reachable goals. Not to run a marathon, but to finish first 2 km. Not to have consistent journaling practice, but to write for 2 minutes every evening.
- ==Two minutes rule== has another advantage. Stop when you are doing especially good. Why? Hemingway did that, and I believe that I've read in somewhere else. Where? #questions 

> Habits must bring joy and satisfaction. 

- Select right field of competition.
- Create ==habits== in areas that ==excite== you and ==match== your ==natural skill==. ^1d1386
	- Align them with your ambitions.
	- But be mindful about them, ambitions are hard to understand.
		- They are hard to come by and even harder to succeeded in reaching them.
	- [[Harry Potter and the methods of rationality#Ambitions]]

When exploring areas where your natural talent might bloom, ask the following questions:
- What feels like fun for me, but work for others?
- What makes me lose track of time?
- Where I get greater return that average guy?
- What comes natural to me?
- [[Harry Potter and the methods of rationality#^af0641]]

`Work hard on things that come easy.`

==REFLECTION==
Organize the system that will provide constant feedback. It is the only way to assess how are you doing and compare yourself with your past.

==IDENTITY==
Be flexible, if the need arise, change. Don't cling to what has been, look at what it is. Adapt to the challenges of life. [[What is rationality]] *lightness* ^c847ce
