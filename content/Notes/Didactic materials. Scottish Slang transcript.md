## Didactic materials. Scottish Slang transcript

**Hodge your weest** means *shut up*. Which is probably what I should do right now as I'm killing my career one moment at a time. 

♪♪ I'm Gerard Butler, and this is Scottish slang. 

**Backy** means *tobacco*, either chewing or smoking. 

**Trolley** is a *shopping cart*. Also, **to be off your trolley** means *you're out of your head, you're very drunk*. He was off his fucking trolley. 

**I dinnae ken** (said twice for emphasis) is more used on the east coast of Edinburgh. It means *I don't know*. 

**Bevy** means *a drink*. Like, "Let's go for a bevy." 

**Airbage** is *a fart*. 

**Ball bag**, or "aye, a wee ball bag," refers to *a scrotum* and is used colloquially to mean *you are a scrotum*. 

**Steaming** is one of our 100,000 words for *being drunk*. 

**Wee bit** means *a little amount*. Like, "were you drunk, or were you steaming? Fuck a wee bit."

**God yourself!** is a *sign of encouragement*. It's not something you often get in Scotland. 

**Oh, your bum's out the windy** means *you're talking nonsense*. 

**Bonnie** is maybe my favorite Scottish word. You know, like "Bonnie Scotland" or "a bonnie wee lass," it means *lovely, beautiful, sweet*. 

**I'm getting the messages** means *I'm going shopping*. So "I'm going to the shop, and I'm getting the messages," because normally when people go shopping, somebody writes it down for them. So they literally have it in message form. Like, "all right, potatoes, all right, carrots, all right, turpentine, okay?" 

**Tatties** means *potatoes*. Like in "mince and tatties," which is our national dish, sadly. It's basically just minced beef and potatoes. 

**Peely Wally** is something that's been used to describe me very often. It means *pale*. Like after a night out, you might say, "oh, you're looking very Peely Wally." 

**Fizzy juice** is really just *soda*. 

**Jobby** means *shit*. It's perhaps the sweetest name that you could ever have for a shit: jobby. I found that funny, but it's maybe because I'm from there. 

**Scran** means *food*. Simple. 

**Hogmanay** is *New Year's Eve*. In Scotland, it's a big, big traditional thing with bringing whiskey, a piece of coal, and an ax if you don't like your neighbor. But if you do, just stick to the whiskey and coal. 

**Pure Barry** means *that's brilliant, it's wonderful*. In Scotland, pretty much everybody is sarcastic all the time. So there's a pretty good chance if you hear "pure Barry," they're actually telling you that you're a dick. Like my friend, a few years ago, who said to me, "Gerry, through all this success, I love that you haven't changed. You're still a dick."

**Rank** means *disgusting*. Like, "oh, Jesus, that was rank." There's pretty much a theme of things in Scotland that are gross, ugly, drunk, and stupid. But I think that pretty much just summed it up. It's actually reminded me a lot about the shit I used to speak. It was rank.
