### On knowledge
> Knowledge is so fragile

- We still try to learn something in the most counterintuitive way, through rote memorization.
	- And we miss the key ingredient of any knowledge ‚Äì understanding.
	- That‚Äôs what essential!

### Simple question
- The simpler the question, the harder is the answer.
	- [[–ì–ª—É–ø—ã–π –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å]]
	- The same approach for discovery Da Vinci used.
	- It‚Äôs a virtue of any man who considers himself a scholar.
		- ***Curiosity.***
	- Feynman took a class in biology, where he put some cell under microscope that under the reaction from sugar began moving. So he asked a question. *‚ÄúHow do they move?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat pushes them around?‚Äù*
		- Nobody knew.

### Don‚Äôt trust the ‚Äúreal guys‚Äù
- Check it for yourself.
	- Even when something sounds reasonable, it doesn‚Äôt mean that it is.
	- Nice looking guy in a suit, well respected influencer, official representative from any agency, they are all just men. Nothing extraordinary.
	- They all make mistakes. Especially if they themselves believe in what they say.
	- A painter once told Feynman that of you mix white and red, you get yellow. 
		- Feynman, who at that moment was studying light, said that it was impossible. 
		- If you mix white and red, you get pink. But the master painter insisted that he get yellow.
		- So when Feynman asked to show him that, out of curiosity, not of spite, painter could produce yellow, only when he added to white and red some yellow pigment.
	- So the conclusion might be only this. Check everything.
	- [[Critical thinking#From data to knowledge via fake news]]

### Self-taught is better than just taught. It arms you with a completely different tool box
- The same idea is described in [[Antifragile Things that gain form disorder]] which book, though, need to look up.
	- Taleb speculated that if you study and a bare minimum to pass synthetic test, then you have time to self-teaching and studying what fascinates you.
	- He suggests to keep three books in rotation, so you won‚Äôt get bored.
- Feynman adds something else. When you are self-taught, you are not used to doing things in the usual way. 
	- He gives an example from Calculus, he taught himself to do integral i peculiar way, not they way it used to back then.
	- So when his fellow student stuck with the equation, Feynman helped him by applying his strange approach.
- So why a successful student couldn‚Äôt do what Feynman did? Because they had prefabricated by school tool box.
	- Feynman made his tools himself and could change anything on demand. Or in accordance with situation.

### Images are faster than words
- When somebody tells a new concept, that hasn‚Äôt been known before, the best way to comprehend and grasp the idea is by imagining it.
	- And if what you are imagining doesn‚Äôt make sense, then with high level of probability it is false and could be invalidated.
	- *Actually, there was a certain amount of genuine quality to my guesses. I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I‚Äôm trying to understand: I keep making up examples. For instance, the mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and they‚Äôre all excited. As they‚Äôre telling me the conditions of the theorem, I construct something which fits all the conditions. You know, you have a set (one ball)‚Äîdisjoint (two halls). Then the balls turn colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head as they put more conditions on. Finally they state the theorem, which is some dumb thing about the ball which isn‚Äôt true for my hairy green ball thing, so I say, ‚ÄúFalse!‚Äú*

### Simplification of textbooks

^0de0cc

- My students are also a great source of inspiration. Often than not, they return me to a previously forgotten topic, or the idea that I think is not important at the moment.
	- With help of their questioning, I deepen understanding of the matter.

	- Chemists, physics, mathematicians are all, give detailed instruction how to solve certain types of tasks.

### A story about the cat and Biology faculty at the Caltech
In the halls of Caltech, the illustrious physicist Richard Feynman once wandered into unfamiliar territory ‚Äì a biology lecture. The topic? The anatomy of a certain feline. As the details unfolded, a chart filled with meticulous measurements caught Feynman‚Äôs eye: nose lengths, distances between eyes, the curve of the ear.

When the moment came for Feynman to address the audience, he highlighted the impressive array of data before posing a deceptively simple question: "Why do these measurements have the values that they do?" The room, filled with seasoned biologists, was stunned. Their meticulous recording hadn't delved into the underlying purpose of these measurements. Evolutionary significance? Functional relevance? They didn‚Äôt have the answers.

Feynman's innocent query highlighted a glaring gap in modern education: the prioritization of data collection over understanding its significance. It's a poignant reminder for today's curriculum designers. While students are trained to absorb and regurgitate information, are they taught to ask the quintessential question ‚Äì "Why?"

This tale underscores the need for a shift in focus. Instead of mere memorization, shouldn't the ultimate aim be nurturing a student‚Äôs innate curiosity, encouraging them to seek the stories and reasons behind the facts?
