## Lesson plan – Jigsawed Yo Hamada Article

To adapt the **Jigsaw Reading** for **three groups of three students each** (9 total students) and ensure a more balanced distribution for cooperative learning, I’ll divide the article into **three manageable parts**, each covering distinct aspects of the shadowing technique. Each group will work on one section, and within the groups, students will focus on subtopics to share with the class. This will allow for collaboration within the groups and smoother teaching to other groups.

### Revised Jigsaw Sections

#### **Group 1&4: Foundations of Shadowing** 
- **Pages:** 386-388 (Introduction to the end of "What is Shadowing?")
- **Subtopics to Divide**:
  1. **Introduction to Shadowing**: Overview, historical background, and purpose of shadowing.
  2. **Listening vs. Shadowing**: Definitions and how shadowing differs from traditional listening methods.
  3. **Shadowing Process**: Examples of shadowing, key features (e.g., real-time repetition, no scripts).

- **Focus**: This group covers the origins of shadowing, introduces how it works, and sets the stage for why it has become an effective teaching method.

**Subtopic 1: Introduction to Shadowing**  
- **Question Type**: *Bridge Building (Activation of Prior Knowledge)*  
  - **Question**: What do we already know about the origins of shadowing and its use in language learning?

**Subtopic 2: Listening vs. Shadowing**  
- **Question Type**: *Analytical Acrobatics (Critical Thinking and Analysis)*  
  - **Question**: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the author's explanation of how shadowing differs from traditional listening techniques?

**Subtopic 3: Shadowing Process**  
- **Question Type**: *Life Situation Lab (Application and Comparison)*  
  - **Question**: How might the shadowing process described by the author be applied in your own language learning practice?

#### **Group 2&5: Cognitive and Listening Processes in Shadowing**
- **Pages:** 388-390 (From "The Cognitive Process of Shadowing" to the end of "Connecting Research and Teaching for Listening")
- **Subtopics to Divide**:
  1. **Cognitive Processes**: Focus on attention, cognitive resources, and how learners process sound in real time.
  2. **Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Processing**: The impact of shadowing on bottom-up listening skills, and the reduced reliance on top-down strategies.
  3. **Research on Listening Benefits**: Summarize studies that show shadowing improves listening comprehension, especially for low-proficiency learners.

- **Focus**: This group deals with the cognitive science behind shadowing and research findings related to listening skill improvement.

**Subtopic 1: Cognitive Processes**  
- **Question Type**: *Analytical Acrobatics (Critical Thinking and Analysis)*  
  - **Question**: Why is the role of cognitive resource important in the shadowing process as explained by the author?

**Subtopic 2: Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Processing**  
- **Question Type**: *Bridge Building (Activation of Prior Knowledge)*  
  - **Question**: How does the author’s discussion of bottom-up and top-down processes in shadowing align with what we already know about these cognitive functions?

**Subtopic 3: Research on Listening Benefits**  
- **Question Type**: *Life Situation Lab (Application and Comparison)*  
  - **Question**: What might be another example of a learning strategy that improves bottom-up processing, similar to shadowing?

#### **Group 3&6: Speaking Skills, Challenges, and Future Directions** 
- **Pages:** 390-393 (From "Connecting Research and Teaching for Speaking" to Conclusion)
- **Subtopics to Divide**:
  1. **Shadowing and Speaking**: How shadowing can develop speaking skills, supported by two studies on pronunciation and comprehensibility.
  2. **Challenges in Research and Practice**: Identify key challenges with shadowing, including areas like learner attention and need for more varied research.
  3. **Shadowing Variations**: Discuss variations like selective shadowing and text-presented shadowing, and their potential impact on learning.

- **Focus**: This group will explain how shadowing applies to speaking skills, discuss the limitations and future research directions, and introduce new variations for classroom use.

**Subtopic 1: Shadowing and Speaking**  
- **Question Type**: *Life Situation Lab (Application and Comparison)*  
  - **Question**: How could the author’s ideas on using shadowing to improve speaking skills be implemented in an advanced language classroom?

**Subtopic 2: Challenges in Research and Practice**  
- **Question Type**: *Analytical Acrobatics (Critical Thinking and Analysis)*  
  - **Question**: What are the possible limitations of shadowing research that the author presents, and do you agree with them? Why or why not?

**Subtopic 3: Shadowing Variations**  
- **Question Type**: *Bridge Building (Activation of Prior Knowledge)*  
  - **Question**: What might be a practical example from your own learning experience that mirrors the author's explanation of selective shadowing?

### Execution of Jigsaw Reading in Cooperative Learning Framework

1. **Preparation** (10 minutes):
   - Each group reads and discusses their assigned section, splitting the subtopics among themselves.
   - Each student becomes an "expert" on their subtopic and helps their groupmates understand it.

2. **Group Collaboration** (10 minutes):
   - Students synthesize their subtopics into a coherent summary for the group, helping each other clarify any confusing points.
   - They also prepare visual aids or key talking points for presenting their section to others.

3. **Mixed Group Sharing** (20 minutes):
   - Rearrange students into mixed groups, with one student from each original group (now experts) in each new group.
   - Each student teaches their new group about their section (including subtopics), ensuring all students understand the full article.

4. **Reflection and Debrief** (10 minutes):
   - Bring the class together for a whole-class discussion.
   - Ask questions like "How does shadowing benefit listening and speaking differently?" or "What challenges do you think students might face when using shadowing?"

This structure integrates well with cooperative learning principles, encouraging individual accountability, group collaboration, and whole-class engagement.
