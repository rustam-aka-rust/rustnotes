## Why invite Socrates into the classroom?

- As I've speculated before, the modern classroom is often [[Why school are boring#A case of poor design|poorly designed]]. What if we could improve it by tweaking the learning process a bit?
	- We can shift from frontal teaching, which most of us are all too familiar with, to group discussions. As I recall, discussions often begin with [[Фундаментальные вопросы для jumpstart а мыслительной деятельности|questions]], and the more intriguing or paradoxical the question, the more engaged the students become.
	- Recently, I had an engaging discussion with medical students when I asked them about what qualifies as a living organism.
	- Their answers were predictable: it can replicate, breed, and be irritable.
		- Naturally, the next question arose: can a computer virus be considered a living organism since it exhibits all of the aforementioned qualities?
		- From there, we delved into [[Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI has hacked the operating system of human civilisation|Harari's]] idea about the source code of civilization and AI bots. Soon after, the lesson concluded.
		- The students were both shocked and amazed, highlighting the importance of a well-structured questioning framework. I believe such a framework can be found within Plato's Dialogues, though an interpreter is essential.
	- The Socratic method is an excellent way to introduce problematic or even [[научное знание|paradoxical situations]]. Its value lies precisely in this.
		- It fosters a specific mindset that is invaluable when grappling with complex problems or significant issues.
		- The challenge is determining how to integrate it into daily activities, helping make sense of life's complexities and better understanding the actions one considers taking.
