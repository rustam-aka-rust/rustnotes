## The Social Nature of Reading and Writing Has Changed
- One of the traits that can be observed with the naked eye is that children use pens and paper less and less.
	- Just on the first of September, I asked children to take notes on the tasks they have to complete before the end of the month. Instead of the scratching of pens on paper, I heard clicks from virtual keyboards.
	- The same day, when I taught future teachers [[Lesson plan -- The Journey of a Hero|The Hero’s Journey]], my students, during a 20-minute breakout activity, used phones to create a short story that exemplified elements of Campbell's classification.
- Screens are replacing paper, and keyboards have displaced pens.
	- The last week of August, parents asked me why their children had such awful handwriting. I answered that they are not used to writing.
	- This statement was met with opposition, which changed into a moment of truth for the majority of them: children do not have a blister on the middle finger of any hand. It only means that they don't use pens as often as we used to.
	- The only thing that has received something resembling regular use is tougher skin on the tips of their big fingers.
- Screens are replacing paper for leisure activities as well as for entertainment at large.
	- LMS, which is essentially a digital learning environment, has become all-pervasive in every educational establishment.
	- LMSs not only encourage children to use digital mediums more but also do not allow otherwise. They have replaced books with screens.
	- And this trait turns people into less socialized individuals in a book-based reading culture.
		- Yet, textual modality is still the main vehicle of information flow.
		- It remains central, regardless of what the medium is—paper, screen, or voice—especially in an educational context.
		- In fact, it will continue to be the most important *cultural* activity, we can safely assume, for centuries to come.
		- It has a peculiarly strong reach and [[Лингвистический принцип универсальности|universality]].
			- It allows communication between different mental faculties, across time and space.
			- And because of that, any changes brought by digitization will have tremendous cognitive, behavioral, and social implications.
