## Desire to Be Entertained Fosters Two-Dimensional People

- The Coliseum exists not to educate, but to amuse. The person who craves mere entertainment suffers more than they realize. 
	- In their pursuit of happiness and an easier life, they deliberately exclude the very experiences that make life truly fulfilling.
	- It is in overcoming challenges that we feel a sensation akin to sexual arousal—[[Why school are boring#^63f6c4|remember Botez]] sister and her triumph over the chess king, Magnus.
- The absence of competition, devoid of healthy struggle and insulated from real-world difficulties, is the hallmark of a two-dimensional person—a byproduct of the consumer culture that proliferates today.
	- These individuals live for pleasure, comfort, and affluence, indulging in the satisfaction of base instincts: to eat, sleep, consume, and watch—never to create, innovate, cultivate, or grow.
	- Their highest aspiration is to be replicated endlessly or to be relieved of their misery through the services of cryotechnology companies. They long to forfeit their human identity and merge with the hive—unnoticed yet felt, obscure yet existent.
		- To me, such an existence is far worse than death: to not create, to not teach, to not feel alive by engaging in meaningful action.
		- Like punching, riding, walking, writing, or conversing. I’ve abandoned all social networks. Today, while I’m not entirely free—I still manage my channel—my focus is primarily on creating something: a lesson, a course, a video.
		- To challenge and to be challenged.
	- Two-dimensional people assert that pleasure, comfort, prosperity, and an endless stream of social media are precisely what they desired, and thus, they convince themselves that they are happy.
		- They cling to the status quo, with money occupying their first, second, and third thoughts.
			- I recall children asking me about my past at Gazpromneft. The first question is invariably, "How much did you earn?" And if it was a significant amount, "Why would you leave that for a position at a school?"
			- They fail to comprehend that life encompasses far more than material wealth. Adults, too—even those worn out by life—often miss the deeper point of money.
			- To me, this obsession with wealth is a clear sign of a two-dimensional person. Yes, money is essential to everyone’s life—I don’t dispute that—but I sincerely believe that whatever amount a person thinks they need, they actually need less. The only barrier to this realization is their inability [[The youth should be inoculated with critically reasoning|to think critically]].
		- Two-dimensional people view God merely as an insurance policy. If something goes wrong, they visit churches or mosques. Their faith doesn’t emerge from within but is imposed from external circumstances.
			- I recall my own experience: though I am a Muslim, I frequently visit churches—my favorite one is in Istra—because I find solace there.
			- It’s a place where I’ve always discovered tranquility, and I still do. Whenever I have the opportunity, I choose to visit a church, not a mosque. I’m unsure why, but I feel a deeper sense of calm in a church.
		- They are never truly surprised. To them, everything is already known, seen, or shown.
			- It’s not the omniscience of my father, who belongs to a different era and believes he has learned all there is to learn. He is someone shaped by TV culture.
			- Those raised in the YouTube era, on the other hand, are never surprised because they assume they’ve seen it all. This mindset extinguishes their curiosity—they expect that if something noteworthy happens, it will simply be presented to them.
		- Lastly, they are content with themselves—when they are not engulfed in despair over the futility of their existence.
			- At times, I think they use distractions—like watching how rock stars live, the travels of social media influencers, or the latest trends among royalty—to suppress the realization that life is meant to be lived in the real world, not through the screen of a phone.
			- The root of their desire for constant entertainment likely stems from an attempt to evade life’s inevitable challenges, which will confront them no matter how much they try to escape.
			- The illusion of a [[The Practicing Stoic#Virtue|"good life"]] they receive through the screen is merely that—an illusion, perpetuating the belief that they can live any way they please.
		- But this is not reality. There is a way to shake them from their stupor, and I believe it lies in the ability of a teacher or mentor—when dealing with adults—to create conflict, something unexpected.
