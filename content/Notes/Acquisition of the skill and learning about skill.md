## Acquisition of the Skill and Learning About the Skill

- The thing that most teachers don’t see, or maybe don’t recognize, is that we have moved past the frontal learning educational space,
    - Where the teacher is the only authority.
    - We've turned into architects of an experience, regardless of what it is: math, language, or history.
    - As I mentioned before, learning and skill acquisition are two different processes.
- One without the other is useless, but finding the balance between them is not so easy.
    - The optimal balance differs between disciplines. Math requires more learning, less practice; languages require less learning, more practice.
    - Or maybe I'm wrong. I might learn math a little to see how it works out.
- The purpose of learning is simple: it helps plan, edit, and make corrections during practice.
    - It clearly defines the boundaries within which a student operates. This is why learning is invaluable. But it requires balancing against practice.
    - Learning enhances practice but cannot possibly substitute for it.
- In school and any academic setting, performance is important, and for it, solely learning is not sufficient.
