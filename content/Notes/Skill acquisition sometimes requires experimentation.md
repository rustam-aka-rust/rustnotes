## Skill Acquisition Sometimes Requires Experimentation

- I've almost forgotten that knowledge is not a static phenomenon; it's always moving and an ever-changing substance.
    - It evolves with actions and through interactions with the environment that provides, preferably, clear and structured feedback.
    - It means, if I've learned something, then I need to go into the world and collide the idea with reality.
        - Even if this is just a simple idea or a complex concept, there wonâ€™t be any trouble implementing some elements of it.
    - It means skill acquisition and learning something new requires trying.
    - Within a classroom, we operate in artificial conditions. In English, we create communicative situations aimed at solving specific problems.
    - In math, it is the process of solving equations on the board.
    - In logic, it is weaving snails, and in reading, it is the interleaving of several aspects of the skill: skimming, decomposition, paraphrasing, and grokking.
- The process of experimentation starts with prediction. Actually, true learning starts with prediction. If we look at it from a different angle, we can see KWL, the second element, want to know.
    - We can base our experiment on understanding how it might work out according to the current knowledge.
    - Predicting and experimenting make skill acquisition much faster.
- Smart experimentation is a variation of the scientific method with four key stages:
    - [[The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch#Reality is not what it appears to be|Observation]]: What are we currently observing?
    - [[Critical thinking#Different search and discovery strategies|Knowns]]: What do you know about the topic already?
    - [[Critical thinking#Explanation, theory, hypothesis|Hypotheses]]: What do you think will improve your performance?
    - [[Thinking happens at the edges of overlapping structures and thinking modes#^54398b|Tests]]: What are you trying next?
- The crucial element of such experimentation is a [[Commonplace books exist not for vanity, but for work|lab journal]].
    - The thing that an experimenter uses to track his progress.
    - It is used to form hypotheses as he practices.
    - Track predictions and generate new ideas.
