## ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes

## üìí Ideas
- In the end, propaganda worked where empathy failed.
- Learned to fit it.
- ***Topics, being an alien among your own kind.***
	- *He may have been wrong. I may have been. But that, that distance‚Äîthat chronic sense of being an alien among your own kind‚Äîit's not entirely a bad thing. It came in especially handy when the real aliens came calling.*
- ***Transhumanism.***
	- *Meat couldn't handle that. I say they're unmanned." "Meat's reinforceable," Sarasti said.*
	- left the building, awaiting only that final technological breakthrough that would herald the arrival of the Great Digital Upload
	- *But it's not. It's just shadows on the cave wall*
	- Flesh and blood had its own relationship to reality: necessary, but not sufficient. *What is sufficient for relationship to reality?*
	- *the will to resist is no less mechanical than the urge to breathe. Both can be subverted with the right neurochemical keys*.
	- In a world in which Humanity had become redundant in unprecedented numbers, we'd both retained the status of another age: working professional.
- ***Aggression. Technology means belligerence.***
	- *Technology Implies Belligerence, they said. I suppose I should explain that, now that it's completely irrelevant. You've probably forgotten after all this time.*
	- If the only thing you can eat is your own kind, empathy is gonna be the first thing that goes. Psychopathy's no disorder in those shoes, eh? Just a survival strategy. But they still make our skin crawl, so we‚Äîchain 'em up."
	- *No, the only environmental factors that continued to matter were those that fought back, that countered new strategies with newer ones, that forced their enemies to scale ever-greater heights just to stay alive. Ultimately, the only enemy that mattered was an intelligent one.*
	- So the best you can do is mix up your strategies based on the odds
- ***Relationship Chelsea and Siri***
	- *Or suppose they throw you a party, Chelsea had replied. Then you don't know whether they're doing it sincerely, or if your earlier interaction just guilted them into observing an occasion they'd rather have ignored. But if you don't tell anyone, and nobody commemorates the event, there's no reason to feel badly because after all, nobody knew. And if someone does buy you a drink then you know it's sincere because nobody would go to all the trouble of finding out when your birthday is‚Äî and then celebrating it‚Äîif they didn't honestly like you.*
	- Chelsea had always said that telepresence emptied the Humanity from Human interaction
- ***Topic of God.***
	- *We do not know their specifications. The Fireflies burned up over Earth." "Then shouldn't you be looking there? When our kids fly, they're on their own." Sascha muted the channel. "You know who we're talking to? Jesus of fucking Nazareth, that's who.*
- ***Rules of life***
	- *But some, and that gives us a chance. Doesn't matter how good you are at poker when it comes to the deal, eh? Cards still deal out with the same odds." "So that's what we're playing. Poker." "Be thankful it's not chess. We wouldn't have a hope in hell."* Game is life. Deals what it wishes and you don‚Äôt know the rules
	- The most altruistic and sustainable philosophies fail before the brute brain-stem imperative of self-interest
	- *Why invent fusion reactors if your climate is comfortable, if your food is abundant? Why build fortresses if you have no enemies? Why force change upon a world which poses no threat?*
	- Perfection's unattainable but it isn't unapproachable, you know—é
	- *When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, you want to keep an eye on anyone whose career-defining moment involves consorting with the enemy.*
	- How long before it dawns on us that the world we see no longer reflects the world we inhabit, that we are blind
	- *G√∂del was right after all: no system can fully understand itself.*
- Information theory.

- Game theory.
	- *The second mouse gets the cheese*
	- We don't." And the others are hacks. "Thing about game theory is, it assumes rational self-interest among the players. And people just aren't rational

- Siri
	- *So. A Synthesist. Explaining the Incomprehensible to the Indifferent.*
	- What's the difference between being dead, and just not knowing you're alive?

- Chinese room. Mental experiment. Has been created to refute possibility and validity of Turing test.
