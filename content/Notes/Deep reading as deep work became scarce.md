## Deep reading as deep work became scarce
- Cal Newport, in his work, explored the notion of [[Deep Work]], he once said that *the high-quality work equals time spent multiplied on the intensity of focus*.
	- Deep reading is an accepted norm in education, but today it is unattainable.
	- The reason behind this, not bad teachers or worsened quality of the children, as my colleagues are used to pointing with the phrase “Have you seen these children? Every year, worse, and worse.”
	- But in my opinion, it’s not them who has the problem, it’s us, teachers.
		- While they are moving with time and technology, we lag in old beliefs, that we know the best.
		- And what if not? What if we don’t know?
	- For young students and newly made readers, reading is less deep, uninterrupted reading. It’s hard for them to feel the joy of [[Good reading is an effortful process|tackling longer and complex text]].
		- For them, reading has an absolutely different meaning.
- The change of a substrate of reading [[The social nature of reading and writing has changed|from paper to screen]] entails new multimodal capabilities, like:
	- Loss of rigidness and material integrity.
	- Replacement of ergonomic, sensorimotor and audiovisual affordances of paper with the similar in function but also different kinds of screen interfaces.
	- These affects reading for study and entertainment.
