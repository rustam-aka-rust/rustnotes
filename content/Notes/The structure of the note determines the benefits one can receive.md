## The Structure of the Note Determines the Benefits One Can Receive

- From my experience, the structure of the note plays a crucial role in the benefits derived from the note-taker's hard work.
    - _Linear_ notes are suitable for a large audience; they are what I use to showcase my expertise.
        - When I have something to share, I write such notes, differing from others, the majority of which contain ideas stored in my vault.
    - _Outline_ notes are the primary method I use to organize and explore ideas.
        - They allow me to easily organize atomic thoughts and provide simple methods for expanding and contracting an idea by splitting or combining indent lines.
        - Higher than linear notes recall rate.
    - However, when I need to understand something complex beyond the text, I require a helicopter view, which _matrices_ can provide.
        - A canvas is a great tool that offers the chance to move ideas around, similar to physically moving pieces of paper on a table.
        - [[An atomic note vs atomic thought|Matrices of thoughts]] are the only way to clearly see connections across categories, between superordinate and subordinate ideas.
            - Matrix of thoughts could be presented in a table view. With columns and lines as subordinate ideas and everything in between as superordinate ideas.
        - Higher than linear notes recall rate. Higher than outline transfer rate.
