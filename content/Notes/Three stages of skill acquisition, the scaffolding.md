## The Three Stages of Skill Acquisition and the Importance of Scaffolding

- Acquiring any skill is a complex endeavor that requires not just knowledge of what to do, but also a [[Deep reading as deep work became scarce|dedicated space and structure]].
    - Space refers to significant time allocated for practice.
        - The one must remember that time is not found, but made by cutting all low-value activities.
        - According to Kaufman, you only need to make twenty hours accessible.
        - And don’t stop until you’ve reached the mark of twenty hours.
            - And then move to another skill.
    - Structure involves focused concentration in creative work.
    - An often overlooked element is flexibility—the ability to determine one's own standards of success.
- In academic circles, the belief in a three-stage model of skill acquisition prevails.
    - This model applies to both mental and physical skills.
    - The first stage is cognitive, where we understand what we are trying to achieve.
        - We conduct research.
        - Think through the process.
        - And break down the skill into incremental parts that are easier to manage.
            - This approach was successfully utilized with the tenth group in logic classes.
    - The second stage is associative, directly connected to the activity itself. We practice the task.
        - During practice, it's important to recognize environmental feedback, as with reinforced learning.
        - Adjust our approach with each iteration.
    - The final stage is autonomous, where we perform effectively without external support and without conscious thought, but still with a degree of attention—usually sufficient and not as extensive as required in the second stage.
- In the end, the skill becomes a meaningful action in itself, has found a place in the existing system and a perpetrator knows the role it plays in the whole.
