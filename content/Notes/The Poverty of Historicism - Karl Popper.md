## üìí Ideas
### Interpretation
- Philosopher only interpreted the world, but they missed the key feature of any interpretation.
	- Changing the world is why we are here. 
	- Are we? Not to live in accord with it, not to be synchronized?

### Problem of Sociology
- **Truly valuable experiments are impossible.**
	- This is because anything we do in sociology is not experimental in the strictest sense of the word.
	- Social experimentation differs fundamentally from experiments in physics.
	- Sociology does not serve as a means to produce knowledge on a large scale but often operates for political purposes.
		- I believe Ariely might disagree with this, but these ideas contain a kernel of truth.
	- Experimentation has been extracted from sociology due to the way such studies are conducted.
		- Rather than working with isolated variables, the elements interact freely in the external world, altering it through their own actions.
	- New points of tension introduce a degree of novelty at the heart of the experiment.
		- Consequently, new conditions emerge. While in physics, the rearrangement of established elements leads to different outcomes, we cannot claim that newly arranged elements in social experiments can genuinely be considered the same as their previous forms.
		- Interaction transforms them irrevocably.
		- In a scenario where nothing can be replicated exactly, the term "isolated conditions" loses its meaning, and genuine novelty arises.
		- So, how do we experiment under such conditions? The brief answer is, we can‚Äôt. Yet humanity endures regardless.
	- Since the true isolation of sociological elements is unattainable, we are confronted with a dual complexity:
		- A complexity stemming from the inability to truly isolate participants in the experiment.
		- The inherent origin of social phenomena. These phenomena emerge from social life, which presupposes mental life, which, in turn, is grounded in biology, chemistry, and ultimately, physics.
		- So many intricate underlying processes shape social interaction. It‚Äôs extraordinarily complex.
	- Any prediction beyond this point becomes virtually impossible, yet humanity persists. ^84b945
		- The interconnected complexity of the system disrupts any initial predictions.
		- Simply put, prediction alters what is predicted.
		- The introduction of new information influences the situation, modifying the conditions it seeks to describe.
			- Whether this new information brings about the expected outcome or prevents it.
			- Popper termed this the ‚ÄúOedipus Effect.‚Äù

- **Prediction is a social event.**
	- It may intersect with other social occurrences, and the predicted event might be among them.
	- When social scientists announce a prediction, they open up a realm of possibilities with diverse potential outcomes.
	- Some of these outcomes may not have been anticipated, and their impact on future developments remains unknown.

- **The holism of historical prediction.**
	- The social group is far more than the simple sum of its parts.
	- A+B differs from B+C, and A+B+C is distinct from both.

### Future is intuitive
- Future is mostly intuitive.
	- Sociology operates in the premises of sympathetic imagination.
	- Which helps us understand historical developments in qualitative terms. We describe certain historical events without understanding them in full, we are not able to cut to the bone of the event.
	- Thus, phrases like ‚Äúin the spirit of age‚Äù, ‚Äúnational character‚Äù are used.
	- Novelty in such context can‚Äôt be casually explained but intuitively grasped.
		- What is novelty in historical events?
	- Qualitative terms are the terms, explaining conflicting tendencies and aims of various social groups that leas to specific results.

> [!NOTE] Why the *problem of universals* in philosophy is the most profound and fundamental?
> The problem of universals is an ancient question from metaphysics that has inspired a range of philosophical topics and disputes:¬†**Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects?**

- Methodological essentialists, school of thought founded by Aristotle. Or at least it is Popper who believes in this.
	- They believe that revealing the true meaning of the phenomenon is prerequisite for scientific research. Some even go further as considering it the main task.
	- The true essence of things is important it goes without saying, but in my worldview it‚Äôs not the most important.  ^785c11
		- Looking for a definition of a word is a completely metaphysical exercise that has nothing to do with the real work required to make any discovery. In other words, definitions are coffins for meaning.
		- What is matter?
		- What is justice?
		- What is force?
		- They are only words on paper, nothing comes out of contemplating them, maybe something useful to machine learning or cognitive linguistic might be found, but it goes as far as that.

### The essence of things emerges through change
- On the topic of change. ^4e5d3f

	- Change is essential to understanding the true self of an age, event, and person. ^883381
		- In order to understand that some object is the same, we have to put it through changes by applying force to it. If it‚Äôs inanimate we can hit it, bend it, cut it, break it. And see how it changes, and look at what stays the same.
		- What hasn‚Äôt changes is the object itself. Essence of it.
			- [[Essentialism The Disciplined Pursuit of Less#^9b9a83]]
		- No matter what we do with the language, the alphabet stays the same, no matter how complex our math has become it is still 0 and 1, if by some chance we will witness the birth of posthuman I can easily bet that he will have DNK.

> History is the narrow sense is the basis for sociology.

### Fallacy of rational planning
 - [[What is rationality]]
	 - Under no way social planning could be rational, because it involves many unpredictable and irrational elements, humans.
	 - Rational planning is an illusion, created by those who formulated the plan. In the end it is an unstable structure, bound to topple, due to the change in force‚Äôs balance involved in implementing the plan.
	 - I don‚Äôt say that not a single plan where changes in social structure won‚Äôt come to fruition, I only assume that no matter what has been planned and no matter who is involved, nothing will go according to plan.
		 - My parents above all know about this fact. I don‚Äôt know if changing career, is a social change, but I will assume that it is.
		 - So when I chose to shift gears and slow a bit, one of them said that if you had a plan, give it a go, but the other added, that I should remember that no plan would survive the impact with reality and I must be ready to maneuver.

		- Thus, it provides the opportunity for actions.
		- Most philosophers consider themselves as thinkers, but not doers.
		- In my opinion, it leads to the faulty conclusion that philosophy is a useless science. Which is not true.
		- [[–°–æ—Ñ–∏—è –†–∞–ø–ø–µ]] said during our talk that `science is not about how to live, but about what it is`.
		- Philosophy is not about how to live, but what action to take.

### True scholars work on interesting problems
- There are so many problems and so little time.
	- It‚Äôs important not to follow passion this demonstrates the eagerness of mind of a scholar, but it leads unavailingly to trivial problems. Which is fun to solve but they don‚Äôt propel humanity forward.

		- [[Essentialism The Disciplined Pursuit of Less#^839ae0]]
		- [[Antifragile book 1#^ed987f]]

### The only reason that we can be dissatisfied with social conditions 
- Is that we don‚Äôt properly understand how they work.
	- Active intervention could lead to worsening the situation.
	- It doesn‚Äôt mean that we have to stand passively and do nothing. 
	- It means that we actually don‚Äôt understand the complexity of social interaction on deep enough level, to be able to intervene with hopes of high success rate.

### Laws and social norms are not universal across centuries
- Experiments that help us discover the social change are not universal, they change and shift as the boiling temperature changes with geographical position.
	- And social conditions vary from historical period to period.
	- Take for example Plato and his republic, the topic of slavery long ago forgotten, and we can‚Äôt fully understand what he had meant. 
	- We can draw some conclusion, maybe with high degree of accuracy, but truly understand it, no. Impossible
	- The same is true to Thomas Moore.
	- It‚Äôs difficult if not impossible to shift our habits of thought and analyses to the social condition of the distant past.
- And subsequently, if you think that social interaction that we can observe in our time universal, we are idiots. We can‚Äôt say what new norms the future might bring.
	- If society changes, man changes too. Change happens at all levels of regularities, which depend on men as the smallest part of society, its atom.
	- That‚Äôs why we are the next level of universality, with 0 and 1, letter and DNA.
