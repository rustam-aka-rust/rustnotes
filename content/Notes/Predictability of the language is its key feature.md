## Predictability of Language is its Key Feature

- Every word has its place in a sentence and in the structure of speech.
	- We recognize that speech is also text delivered orally.
	- The intriguing thing about guesswork is that we can predict, from the first written or uttered word, what the dialogue will be about.
		- Or at least where it's headed.
		- Beware of word markers. They signal the intention of the text and symbolize value. Word markers, such as "either," "however," "although," etc., provide necessary clues, but many people overlook them.
		- When you see the word "if" in a sentence, expecting "then" is only logical. Similarly, seeing "however" at the beginning suggests an upcoming contradiction.
	- The same [[Когда книга учит#^af6eae|pattern of predictability]] applies to the flow of ideas. The author presents them sequentially.
		- The discerning reader understands the rules of engagement with the book — how to approach it and what signs to be wary of.
	- The structure of words in a text can transform something simple and banal into something unexpected and creative, like the idea of a [[Когда книга учит#^b1c752|well-redacted pine]], or even a limerick.
		- In journalism, they say that when a dog bites a man, it's hardly news, but when a man bites a dog, that's a story.
		- The same words, arranged differently, create something new and captivating.
			- From the phrase "a dog bites," you might infer it's biting a person or perhaps another animal.
			- But when you read "a person bites," you generally expect words like "cake," "meat," or "pie" to follow, not "dog." This unexpected pairing grabs attention and piques curiosity.
		- This is the beauty of language.
			- We can not only create anything but any possible combination.
				- It might be similar to the [[Лингвистический принцип универсальности|concept of universality]].
			- This is particularly valuable when conveying abstract ideas. That's where the beauty of language truly shines.
