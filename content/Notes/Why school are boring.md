## Why school is boring
#### We are bored to the bone
- Educational system is not exciting for several reasons.
- People can make the educational system more exciting by doing this.
- The educational system is gaining years, and must rejuvenate according to the years of schoolers. The general [[Designing a conceptual model|concept of the school]] is outdated and requires new blood transmission. Affordances, signifiers, mapping and the way teachers provide feedback, are outdated.
	- Why are children quickly getting bored at school? It’s obviously that the majority of lessons are made in the old, primitive way.
	- Moreover, a generation gap doesn’t help, it creates a rift between teachers and students.
	- Teachers want to persuade us in their virtue, but they do not hear children.
	- The educational system should allow young people in the system, so they can speak up their minds and improve it.
		- The main barrier between children and teacher is that they do not [[проблема общения на уроке|hear each other]].
- Indifferent head teachers do nothing to make an educational system more exciting, they don’t even make simple changes. ^815b60
	- Majority of classes are not engaging because tutors don’t have any passion for their work.
	- The reason for that is the difference between the skills of students. Educators are fond of teaching more intelligent students. Moreover, it will better and more interesting to study together with another student of equal skill.
	- Furthermore, the environment plays a crucial role, for example, most of the desks and chairs is schools are not modern and comfortable. As a result, it makes students think more about comfort than a content of a lesson.
	- Teachers and students should create a list of possible solutions for these problems and collaborate.

### A case of poor design
- Schools are boring not only because the curricular is outdated and teachers are obsolete in some way, but also because of the design in a broad sense.
	- Bad design makes our lives not only worse, but also dangerous[^1].
	- It gives rise to many problems, boring and discouraging learning [[Why a problem of bad design persists in the modern schools|environment]] is one of them, and as far as I can see, the issue of the utmost importance.
	- Mary G, once said that education entered the stage of anthropocentric paradigm, which means everything revolves around human and salient agent who interacts with conditions he finds himself in. ^e196f3
	- It means that the design of everything inside an educational institution must serve human and not the purpose of teaching. 
		- Learning is the main goal, but it must be a byproduct of activity.
		- And activity has to include the cognitive and emotional aspects. ^eb54db
			- Something funny about emotions and problem-solving. This is what [[Thinking Fast and Slow|Kahneman]] spoke about.
		- As well as the body. It should also be taken into account. Teaching as a learning is not only mental activity but physical. And if it is physical, than it [[The reading environment is often left out of the picture, though it impacts reading significantly#^4a2ba4|embodied experience]].

### Organization of the material
- Before we dive into the process, I’d like to cover the topic of what is wrong with the subjects.
	- Any discipline is taught not for the sake of teaching how to think, but for the content they can provide. Math – calculate, history – to know the country, civil science – to understand how the world works and so on.
	- But what they should be taught for is to think because of the knowledge they provide more clearly, open gates for cultural enrichment.
	- Disciplines at school must aim at improving higher mental abilities of the student, in other words, teach them how to think.
		- Present way of [[Contradicting assumption of what might be important for students|inquiry into the way the world works]], the nature of science, math, art, and the social studies.
	- For this, we have to learn how to make use [[Antifragile books 4 and 5#^65251c|of observation, reflection on these observations, experimentation with phenomena]] and the use of first data and daily experiences along with printed sources[^2].
- Procedures behind material organization must be based on the in-depth understanding of [[Language in 21st century transformed significantly|digital literacy]].
	- That text, which is used in the foundation of education, has evolved from [[The digitization of the technology has changed reading forever|a print-based medium]][^3] to a dynamic and interactive entity.
	- Not many education practitioners as well literacy scholars meet the expectations and needs of digital native children. What’s more daunting, is that they don’t even consider the possibility of drawing wisdom from their expertise.
		- Hence, the gap between old-fashioned print and digital, out-of-classroom practices is never breached.
		- We are used to studying in way, print-based way, but interact with information in another, through digital medium. And that brings tension and dissonance between what we usually do and must do to become an educated person.
	- There is another approach in the modern world. Instead of banning gadgets, we need to incorporate them in the educational process[^4].
		- The first task is to find the paper itself, I’ve requested it from the author on ResearchGate. It takes time.
